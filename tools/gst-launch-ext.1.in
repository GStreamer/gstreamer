gst\-launch\-ext \- Run a predefined GStreamer pipeline
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBgst\-launch\-ext\fR \fIfilename [filename...]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fIgst\-launch\-ext\fP is a tool that is used to run a basic predefined 
\fIGStreamer\fP pipeline.  This application is only used as a quick test to 
ensure proper working of codecs and GStreamer.  It doesn't handle more advanced
features like synchronisation.

All supported formats in GStreamer should be playable by simply typing:

 gst\-launch\-ext filename

It will also print out the pipeline it uses, so you can customize it using
cut and paste.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.LP 
\fIgst\-launch\-ext\fP can be configured by creating a .gst file in your
home directory.  This is a perl-style configuration file and can override
the defaults for audio and video output sinks.

Here is an example .gst file that implements the same defaults as hard-coded
in the script :

AUDIOSINK = osssink
VIDEOSINK = ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink

You can change osssink to esdsink or alsasink (if you have
the plug-in), and you can change xvimagesink to ximagesink, aasink
or sdlvideosink.

Other plug-ins might be used as well if GStreamer has them.
