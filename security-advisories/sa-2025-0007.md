## Details

A buffer overflow in the H.266 video bitstream parser that can cause crashes
for certain input files, and could possibly also allow code execution
through stack manipulation.

## Impact

It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a buffer overflow
that can result in a crash of the application and possibly also allow code
execution through stack manipulation.

## Solution

The gst-plugins-bad 1.26.3 release addresses the issue. People using older
1.26.x versions of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
