## Details

An out of bounds write in the H.266 video bitstream parser when parsing
Adaptation Parameter Sets (APS) can cause crashes for certain input files,
and could possibly also allow code execution through stack manipulation.

## Impact

It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a buffer overflow
that can result in a crash of the application and possibly also allow code
execution through stack manipulation.

## Solution

The gst-plugins-bad 1.28.1 release addresses the issue. People using older
versions of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
