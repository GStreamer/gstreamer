## Details

A missing bounds check in the H.265 video parser could cause a crash for
certain malformed input files through memory exhaustion.

## Impact

It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a crash of the
application through a specially-crafted input file.

## Solution

The gst-plugins-bad 1.28.1 release addresses the issue. People using older
versions of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
