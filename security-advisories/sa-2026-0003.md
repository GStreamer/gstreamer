## Details

Heap-based Buffer Overflow when parsing Huffman tables in JPEG files, at copying
the data to a storage variable.

## Impact

It might be possible for a malicious third party to trigger a crash in the
application, and possibly also effect code execution through heap manipulation.

## Threat mitigation

The code now does bound checking with the storage variables.

The gst-plugins-bad 1.28.1 release address the issue. People using
older branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.

## Workarounds

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties or
accessing untrusted remote sites, or not use VA JPEG decoder and encoder, or
`parse-jpeg` example.

## Solution

The gst-plugins-bad 1.28.1 release addresses the issue. People
using older branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile, or
disable the VA plugin and remove the `parse-jpep` example.
