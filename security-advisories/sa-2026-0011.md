</div>

## Details

An out-of-bound write in the H.266 video bitstream parser when parsing picture
partitions can cause crashes for certain input files, and could possibly also
allow code execution through heap manipulation.

## Impact

It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a buffer overflow
that can result in a crash of the application and possibly also allow code
execution through stack manipulation.

## Solution

The gst-plugins-bad 1.28.1 release addresses the issue. People using older
versions of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
