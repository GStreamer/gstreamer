Release notes for GStreamer 1.10.5

The GStreamer team is proud to announce the fifth bugfix release in the stable
1.10 release series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!


This release only contains bugfixes and it is safe to update from 1.10.x.


See /releases/1.10/ for the full release notes.



This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
