Release notes for GStreamer Base Plug-ins 0.10.26 "You will know when you get there"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer Base Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.



This module contains a set of reference plugins, base classes for other
plugins, and helper libraries.

This module is kept up-to-date together with the core developments.  Element
writers should look at the elements in this module as a reference for
their development.

This module contains elements for, among others:

  device plugins: x(v)imagesink, alsa, v4lsrc, cdparanoia
  containers: ogg
  codecs: vorbis, theora
  text: textoverlay, subparse
  sources: audiotestsrc, videotestsrc, gnomevfssrc
  network: tcp
  typefind
  audio processing: audioconvert, adder, audiorate, audioscale, volume
  visualisation: libvisual
  video processing: ffmpegcolorspace
  aggregate elements: decodebin, playbin


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect



  

Features of this release
    
      * Parallel installability with 0.8.x series
      * Threadsafe design and API
      * playbin2: make about-to-finish signal work for raw sources (e.g. audio CDs)
      * playbin2: fix handling of the native audio/video flags
      * playbin2: add flag to enable decodebin buffering
      * playbin2: make subtitle error handling more robust and ignore late errors
      * playbin2: improve subtitle passthrough in uridecodebin
      * playbin2: new subtitleoverlay element for generic subtitle overlaying
      * playbin2: proxy notify::volume and notify::mute from the volume/mute
                elements (or audio sink)
      * playbin2: don't stop completely on initialization errors from subtitle
                elements; instead disable the subtitles and play the other
                parts of the stream
      * decodebin2: rewrite autoplugging and how groups of pads are exposed
      * uridecodebin: add use-buffering property that will perform buffering on
                parsed or demuxed media.
      * GstXOverlay: flesh out docs and add example for use with Gtk+ >= 2.18
      * libgsttag: add utility functions for ISO-639 language codes and tags
      * oggdemux: use internal granulepos<->timestamp mapper and make oggdemux
                more like a 'normal' demuxer that outputs timestamps
      * oggdemux: seeking improvements
      * subparse: add qttext support
      * ffmpegcolorspace: prefer transforming alpha formats to alpha formats
                and the other way around
      * libgstvideo: add functions to create/parse still frame events.
      * theoraenc: make the default quality property 48.
      * videotestsrc: add pattern with out-of-gamut colors
      * theora: port to 'new' theora 1.0 API; make misc. existing properties
                have no effect (quick, keyframe-mindistance, noise-sensitivity,
                sharpness, keyframe_threshold); those either never worked or
                aren't needed/provided/useful any longer with the newer API
      * typefinding: misc. performance improvements and fixes
      * baseaudiosink: make drift tolerance configurable
