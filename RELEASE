This is GStreamer gst-plugins-ugly 1.14.2.

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce another bug-fix release in the
stable 1.x API series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!

The 1.14 release series adds new features on top of the 1.12 series and is
part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer multimedia
framework.

Full release notes can be found at:

  https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.14/

Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided shortly
after the release.

This module will not be very useful by itself and should be used in conjunction
with other GStreamer modules for a complete multimedia experience.

 - gstreamer: provides the core GStreamer libraries and some generic plugins

 - gst-plugins-base: a basic set of well-supported plugins and additional
                     media-specific GStreamer helper libraries for audio,
                     video, rtsp, rtp, tags, OpenGL, etc.

 - gst-plugins-good: a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred
                     license

 - gst-plugins-ugly: a set of well-supported plugins which might pose
                     problems for distributors

 - gst-plugins-bad: a set of plugins of varying quality that have not made
                    their way into one of core/base/good/ugly yet, for one
                    reason or another. Many of these are are production quality
                    elements, but may still be missing documentation or unit
                    tests; others haven't passed the rigorous quality testing
                    we expect yet.

 - gst-libav: a set of codecs plugins based on the ffmpeg library. This is
                    where you can find audio and video decoders and encoders
                    for a wide variety of formats including H.264, AAC, etc.

 - gstreamer-vaapi: hardware-accelerated video decoding and encoding using
                    VA-API on Linux. Primarily for Intel graphics hardware.

 - gst-omx: hardware-accelerated video decoding and encoding, primarily for
                    embedded Linux systems that provide an OpenMax
                    implementation layer such as the Raspberry Pi.

 - gst-rtsp-server: library to serve files or streaming pipelines via RTSP

 - gst-editing-services: library an plugins for non-linear editing
