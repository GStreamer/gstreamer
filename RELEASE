Release notes for GStreamer 1.6.4


The GStreamer team is pleased to announce a new bug-fix release in the
old 1.6 stable series of the core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from 1.6.x.
For a full list of bugfixes see Bugzilla.
 

This release maintains API/ABI backwards compatibility with the
GStreamer 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 release series.


The 1.x series has been reworked for more flexible memory handling, improved
caps negotiation and re-negotiation, better handling of dynamic pipelines,
and increased performance in general. It also features countless other feature
additions and enhancements.


This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
