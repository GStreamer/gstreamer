Release notes for GStreamer OpenMAX IL wrapper plugin 1.10.3

The GStreamer team is proud to announce the third bugfix release in the stable
1.10 release series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!


This release only contains bugfixes and it is safe to update from 1.10.x. For a
full list of bugfixes see Bugzilla.


See /releases/1.10/ for the full release notes.


This module contains a plugin that wraps available OpenMAX IL
components and makes them available as standard GStreamer
elements.



Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
