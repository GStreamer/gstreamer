# Release notes snippets

When implementing new features, or newsworthy changes, please include a
release notes snippet with your Merge Request by adding a new Markdown file in
`release-notes/snippets/my-feature.md`.

That new file must start with a 2nd level title:
```md
## My new feature

New property `foo` in element `myelement` to control processing behavior.
```
