TODO

- Check if video and MPEG audio streams have the same eof bug as I found
in AC3 audio.

- Need to add general facility for enforcing max STD buffer delay for audio
  and for warning if constraints for particular formats are exceeded.

- Make VBR more efficient (a skip for long periods where no sector is emitted).


- Complete tidying up the systems.cc structure.   Non-duplication of the
	header generation stuff would be neat if it can be managed...


- Add checking for changed sequence parameters in mid-sequence sequence headers.


- Currently the VCD HR Stills muxing stuff assumes *all* HR stills
  are the same size which is given in the initial vbv_buffer_size...
	This will work with mpeg2enc (which does this) but will fail fail fail
	with other streams.

- Rebuild initial delay / sequence splitting DTS adjustment stuff so
	different streams can have different starting delays based on
	*stream* parameters.  I.e. delay should be delegated to the elementary
	streams with only a sector_prefix offset set centrally.

- Tidy code so Elementary streams handle their mux parameter initialisation
	from cmd-line parameters *not* the output stream.




Eventually:

- Full SVCD (MPEG audio extension) support.

- DVD muxing and generation of info for .IFO's etc.
