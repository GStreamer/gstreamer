MODIFICATIONS TO ORIGINAL

July 2000 Andrew Stevens
	 Trivial modifications to support catenated audio stremas and
	  non-intractive use.
August 2000 Andrew Stevens
	Modifed to support multiplexing of variable bit-rate
	video streams. Seems to work well.
August 2000 Andrew Stevens
	Removed use of temporary files for storing stream data.
	Increased performance through the use of a more efficient bitstream 
	library.
	Eliminated arithmetic overflow errors for large streams.
	Initial support for multiplexing variable bit-rate streams.

Novermber 2000 Andrew Stevens
	Clean up code to suit modern compilers with 64-bit int support.
	Cleaned up packet size calculations to make the code more flexible.
	Initial MPEG-2 support
	Support for splitting output streams (not yet completely implemented)
	Support for multiplexing for VCD.

Jan 2001-
	
	Reengineered in C++
	Support for SVCD.
	Support for basic DVD
	VBR Audio as well as video.
	Clean stream splitting support.
	Class structure to simplify adding new stream types

	Encapsulation and modularistion
