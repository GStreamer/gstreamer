This file contains a list of things to be done as well some open issues (questions) related to design/implementation.

INFO:

1- To see the list of tags current mapped:
  http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/ext/metadata/metadata_mapping.htm?view=co 

TODO:

1- Add more individual tags to XMP, EXIF and IPTC
2- Get properties like 'width' and 'height' from caps
3- Review the code (in order to move to gst-plugins-good)
4- Document how the plugin works (atchitecture and interaction beteween modules)
5- Improve the test application (to save also in png and to make it possible to set the metadata elements properties)
6- Implement GDateTime support in GLib to be used by GStreamer (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50076)
7- Use a standard GStreamer Data-Time type to map our Data-time tags
8- Make the correct merge mode for multiple value tags (bag and seq) like dc:creator, ...

OPEN ISSUES:

1- What is (How) the best way to delete some tag?
2- How to change metadata when the orignal image was modified.
  ex: file.jpeg has XMP, then we do filesrc ! metadataparse ! jpegdec ! pngenc ! metadatamux ! files
  is the metadata still valid? which fields are no valid anymore?
3- In EXIF, how to make sure we are compliant with the specification when adding some tag? For example, we are not considerinb what are mandatory (or optional) IFDs for tags.
4- Add GST_TYPE_FRACTION support for GStreamer TAGS
5- currently, in JPEG files, if there is a Photoshop segment, everything inside it but IPTC will be lost. From the point of view of implementation it is easy, but I still don't now how to solve from the point of view of "designing". Anyway I think it is not so important.
6- language is not considered in XMP (How to do it with GStreamer?)
7- Add a helper function that convert from value to string. For example,
aperture-size is 2.7 and the app wants to show "f/2.7", 'contrast' is a range
and the app wants to show as "Normal", "Soft", "Hard". For the time being it is
up to the APP to make this conversion.

KNOWN BUGS

bugs in libexif:

1- https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=112272&aid=1884609&group_id=12272

  a- EXIF_TAG_ISO_SPEED_RATINGS should be in EXIF_IFD_EXIF
  b- EXIF_TAG_ISO_SPEED_RATINGS is not inserted anyway

2- EXIF_TAG_FLASH can't be written from the scratch

3- GST_TAG_CAPTURE_COLOR_SPACE can't be written from the scratch
