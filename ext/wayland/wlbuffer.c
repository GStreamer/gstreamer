/* GstWlBuffer wraps wl_buffer and provides a mechanism for preventing
 * buffers from being re-used while the compositor is using them. This
 * is achieved by adding a reference to the GstBuffer as soon as its
 * associated wl_buffer is sent to the compositor and by removing this
 * reference as soon as the compositor sends a wl_buffer::release message.
 *
 * This mechanism is a bit complicated, though, because it adds cyclic
 * references that can be dangerous. The reference cycles looks like:
 *
 *   ----------------
 *   | GstWlDisplay | ---------------------------->
 *   ----------------                              |
 *                                                 |
 *                                                 V
 *   -----------------     -------------     ---------------
 *   | GstBufferPool | --> | GstBuffer | ==> | GstWlBuffer |
 *   |               | <-- |           | <-- |             |
 *   -----------------     -------------     ---------------
 *
 * A GstBufferPool normally holds references to its GstBuffers and each buffer
 * holds a reference to a GstWlBuffer (saved in the GstMiniObject qdata).
 * When a GstBuffer is in use, it holds a reference back to the pool and the
 * pool doesn't hold a reference to the GstBuffer. When the GstBuffer is unrefed
 * externally, it returns back to the pool and the pool holds again a reference
 * to the buffer.
 *
 * Now when the compositor is using a buffer, the GstWlBuffer also holds a ref
 * to the GstBuffer, which prevents it from returning to the pool. When the
 * last GstWlBuffer receives a release event and unrefs the last GstBuffer,
 * the GstBufferPool will be able to stop and if no-one is holding a strong
 * ref to it, it will be destroyed. This will destroy the pool's GstBuffers and
 * also the GstWlBuffers. This will all happen in the same context of the last
 * gst_buffer_unref, which will be called from the buffer_release() callback.
 *
 * The problem here lies in the fact that buffer_release() will be called
 * from the event loop thread of GstWlDisplay, so it's as if the display
 * holds a reference to the GstWlBuffer, but without having an actual reference.
 * When we kill the display, there is no way for the GstWlBuffer, the associated
 * GstBuffer and the GstBufferPool to get destroyed, so we are going to leak a
 * fair ammount of memory.
 *
 * Normally, this rarely happens, because the compositor releases buffers
 * almost immediately and when waylandsink stops, they are already released.
 *
 * However, we want to be absolutely certain, so a solution is introduced
 * by registering all the GstWlBuffers with the display and explicitly
 * releasing all the buffer references as soon as the display is destroyed.
 *
 * When the GstWlDisplay is finalized, it takes a reference to all the
 * registered GstWlBuffers and then calls gst_wl_buffer_force_release_and_unref,
 * which releases the potential reference to the GstBuffer, destroys the
 * underlying wl_buffer and removes the reference that GstWlDisplay is holding.
 * At that point, either the GstBuffer is alive somewhere and still holds a ref
 * to the GstWlBuffer, which it will release when it gets destroyed, or the
 * GstBuffer was destroyed in the meantime and the GstWlBuffer gets destroyed
 * as soon as we remove the reference that GstWlDisplay holds.
