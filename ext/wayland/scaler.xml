    <description summary="surface cropping and scaling">
      The global interface exposing surface cropping and scaling
      capabilities is used to instantiate an interface extension for a
      wl_surface object. This extended interface will then allow
      cropping and scaling the surface contents, effectively
      disconnecting the direct relationship between the buffer and the
      surface size.

  <interface name="wl_viewport" version="1">
    <description summary="crop and scale interface to a wl_surface">
      An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
      client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface
      contents.

      This interface allows to define the source rectangle (src_x,
      src_y, src_width, src_height) from where to take the wl_buffer
      contents, and scale that to destination size (dst_width,
      dst_height). This state is double-buffered, and is applied on the
      next wl_surface.commit.

      Before the first set request, the wl_surface still behaves as if
      there was no crop and scale state. That is, no scaling is applied,
      and the surface size is as defined in wl_surface.attach.

      The crop and scale state causes the surface size to become
      dst_width, dst_height. This overrides whatever the attached
      wl_buffer size is, unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is
      NULL, the surface has no content and therefore no size.

      The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
      the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
        1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
        2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
        3. crop and scale (wl_viewport.set)
      This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
      are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
      i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
      if the crop and scale was not applied.

      If the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of the
      wl_buffer, then the surface contents are undefined (not void), and
      the surface size is still dst_width, dst_height.

      The x, y arguments of wl_surface.attach are applied as normal to
      the surface. They indicate how many pixels to remove from the
      surface size from the left and the top. In other words, they are
      still in the surface-local coordinate system, just like dst_width
      and dst_height are.

      If the wl_surface associated with the wl_viewport is destroyed,
      the wl_viewport object becomes inert.

      If the wl_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale
      state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied
      on the next wl_surface.commit.
