The esdsink plugin
==================

The esdsink plugin is for outputting an audio stream to an esd soundserver, whether local or on a remote machine 

esdsink has 2 arguments that it accepts:
 - 'mute'      (boolean value)
 - 'depth'     (sample depth in bits- defaults to 16)
 - 'host'      (used only if you want to connect to a remote esd soundserver)
 - 'frequency' (integer value in Hz)
 - 'channels'  (number of channels - 2 for stereo)
