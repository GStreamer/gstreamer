    <title>What is GStreamer?</title>
    <para> 
      GStreamer is a framework for creating streaming media applications.
      The fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate
      Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectShow.

    <para>
      GStreamer's development framework makes it possible to write any type of
      streaming multimedia application. The GStreamer framework is designed to make it easy to
      write applications that handle either audio or video or both. The pipeline design is made to have 
      no extra overhead above what the applied filters induce. This makes GStreamer a good framework for designing
      even high-end audio applications which puts high demands on latency.

    <para>
      One of the the most obvious uses of GStreamer is using it to build a media player.
      GStreamer already includes components for building a media player that can support a
      very wide variety of formats including mp3, Ogg Vorbis, Mpeg1, Mpeg2, Avi, Quicktime, mod
      and so on. 
      GStreamer, however, is much more than just another media player. Its
      main advantages are that the pluggable components also make it possible
      to write a full fledged video or audio editing application.

    <para>
      The framework is based on plugins that will provide the various codec 
      and other functionality. The plugins can be connected and arranged in
      a pipeline. This pipeline defines the flow of the data. Pipelines can 
      also be edited with a GUI editor and saved as XML so that pipeline
      libraries can be made with a minimum of effort.
    </para> 

    <para>
      The GStreamer core function is to provide a framework for plugins, data flow 
      and media type handling/negotiation. 
      It also provides an API to write applications using the various plugins.

    <para>
      This book is about GStreamer from a developer's point of view; it describes
      how to write a GStreamer application using the GStreamer libraries and tools.
