  <title>Your first application</title>
  <para>
    This chapter will summarize everything you've learned in the previous
    chapters. It describes all aspects of a simple &GStreamer; application,
    including initializing libraries, creating elements, packing elements
    together in a pipeline and playing this pipeline. By doing all this,
    you will be able to build a simple Ogg/Vorbis audio player.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="section-helloworld">
    <title>Hello world</title>
    <para>
      We're going to create a simple first application, a simple Ogg/Vorbis
      command-line audio player. For this, we will use only standard
      &GStreamer; components. The player will read a file specified on
      the command-line. Let's get started!
    </para>
    <para>
      We've learned, in <xref linkend="chapter-init"/>, that the first thing
      to do in your application is to initialize &GStreamer; by calling
      <function>gst_init ()</function>. Also, make sure that the application
      includes <filename>gst/gst.h</filename> so all function names and
      objects are properly defined. Use <function>#include
      &lt;gst/gst.h&gt;</function> to do that.
    </para>
    <para>
      Next, you'll want to create the different elements using
      <function>gst_element_factory_make ()</function>. For an Ogg/Vorbis
      audio player, we'll need a source element that reads files from a
      disk. &GStreamer; includes this element under the name
      <quote>filesrc</quote>. Next, we'll need something to parse the
      file and decoder it into raw audio. &GStreamer; has two elements
      for this: the first parses Ogg streams into elementary streams (video,
      audio) and is called <quote>oggdemux</quote>. The second is a Vorbis
      audio decoder, it's conveniently called <quote>vorbisdec</quote>.
      Since <quote>oggdemux</quote> creates dynamic pads for each elementary
      stream, you'll need to set a <quote>pad-added</quote> event handler
      on the <quote>oggdemux</quote> element, like you've learned in
      <xref linkend="section-pads-dynamic"/>, to link the Ogg parser and
      the Vorbis decoder elements together. At last, we'll also need an
      audio output element, we will use <quote>alsasink</quote>, which
      outputs sound to an ALSA audio device.
    </para>
    <para>
      The last thing left to do is to add all elements into a container
      element, a <classname>GstPipeline</classname>, and iterate this
      pipeline until we've played the whole song. We've previously
      learned how to add elements to a container bin in <xref
      linkend="chapter-bins"/>, and we've learned about element states
      in <xref linkend="section-elements-states"/>. We will also attach
      a message handler to the pipeline bus so we can retrieve errors
      and detect the end-of-stream.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's now add all the code together to get our very first audio
      player:

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>
      This concludes our first example. As you see, setting up a pipeline
      is very low-level but powerful. You will see later in this manual how
      you can create a more powerful media player with even less effort
      using higher-level interfaces. We will discuss all that in <xref
      linkend="part-highlevel"/>. We will first, however, go more in-depth
      into more advanced &GStreamer; internals.
    </para>
    <para>
      It should be clear from the example that we can very easily replace
      the <quote>filesrc</quote> element with some other element that
      reads data from a network, or some other data source element that
      is better integrated with your desktop environment. Also, you can
      use other decoders and parsers to support other media types. You
      can use another audio sink if you're not running Linux, but Mac OS X,
      Windows or FreeBSD, or you can instead use a filesink to write audio
      files to disk instead of playing them back. By using an audio card
      source, you can even do audio capture instead of playback. All this
      shows the reusability of &GStreamer; elements, which is its greatest
      advantage.
