    This chapter of the guide introduces the basic concepts of &GStreamer;.
    Understanding these concepts will help you see the issues involved in
    extending &GStreamer;. Many of these concepts are explained in greater
    detail in the &GstAppDevMan;. The basic concepts presented here serve mainly
    to refresh your memory.

    <title>Elements and Plugins</title>
    <para>
      Elements are at the core of &GStreamer;. In the context of plugin
      development, an <emphasis>element</emphasis> is an object derived from the
      <classname>GstElement</classname> class. An element provides some sort of
      functionality when connected with other elements. Without elements,
      &GStreamer; is just a bunch of conceptual pipe fittings with nothing to
      connect. A large number of elements ship with &GStreamer;, but extra
      elements can also be written. The purpose of this guide is to help you
      learn to create new elements, which are encapsulated in plugins as
      described below.
    </para>
    <para>
      A <emphasis>filter</emphasis> is an important type of element that
      processes a stream of data, as opposed to producing or consuming streams
      of data. Producers and consumers of data are called
      <emphasis>source</emphasis> and <emphasis>sink</emphasis> elements,
      respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      Just writing a new element is not entirely enough, however: You will need
      to encapsulate your element in a plugin to enable &GStreamer; to use it. A
      <emphasis>plugin</emphasis> is essentially a loadable block of code,
      usually a shared object file or dynamically linked library. A single
      plugin may contain the implementation of several elements, or just a
      single one. For simplicity, this guide concentrates primarily on plugins
      containing one filter type element.
    </para>
    <para>
      The plugin mechanism is used everywhere in &GStreamer;, even if only the
      standard package is being used. A few very basic functions reside in the
      core library, and all others are implemented in plugins. A plugin registry
      is used to store the details of the plugins in an XML file. This way, a
      program using &GStreamer; does not have to load all plugins to determine
      which are needed. Plugins are only loaded when their provided elements are
      requested.

  <sect1 id="sect1-basics-pads" xreflabel="Pads">
    <title>Pads</title>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Pads</emphasis> are used to negotiate connections and data flow
      between elements in &GStreamer;. A pad can be viewed as a
      <quote>place</quote> on an element where connections may be made with
      other elements. Pads have specific data handling capabilities: That is, a
      pad only knows how to give or receive certain types of data. Connections
      are only allowed when the capabilities of two pads are compatible.
    </para>
    <para>
      An analogy may be helpful here. A pad is similar to a plug or jack on a
      physical device. Consider, for example, a home theater system consisting
      of an amplifier, a DVD player, and a television. Connecting the DVD player
      to the amplifier is allowed only because both devices have audio jacks,
      and connecting the television to the DVD player is allowed because both
      devices have compatible video jacks. Pads in &GStreamer; serve the same
      purpose as the jacks in the home theater system.

  <sect1 id="sect1-basics-buffers" xreflabel="Buffers">
    <title>Buffers</title>
    <para>
      All streams of data in &GStreamer; are chopped up into chunks that are
      passed from a source pad on one element to a sink pad on another element.
      <emphasis>Buffers</emphasis> are structures used to hold these chunks of
      data. Buffers can be of any size, theoretically. Buffers may contain any
      sort of data that the two pads involved know how to handle: Normally, a
      buffer contains a chunk of some sort of audio or video data that flows
      from one element to another.
    </para>
    <para>
      Buffers also contain metadata describing the buffer's contents. Some of
      the important types of metadata are:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A pointer to the buffer's data.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            An integer indicating the size of the buffer's data.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A <classname>GstData</classname> object describing the type of the

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A reference count indicating the number of elements currently
            holding a reference to the buffer. When the buffer reference count
            falls to zero, the buffer will be unlinked, and its memory will be
            freed in some sense (see the next part about <xref
            linkend="sect2-buffers-bufferpools"/> for more details).

    <sect2 id="sect2-buffers-bufferpools" xreflabel="Buffer Allocation and

      <title>Buffer Allocation and Buffer Pools</title>
      <para>
        Buffers can be allocated using various schemes, and they may either be
        passed on by an element or unreferenced, thus freeing the memory used by
        the buffer.
      </para>
      <para>
        Normally, filter elements in &GStreamer; deal with a buffer in place,
        meaning that they do not create or destroy buffers. Sometimes, however,
        elements might need to alter the reference count of a buffer to copy or
        destroy the buffer, or to create a new buffer. For the most part, this
        guide does not deal with elements that alter a buffer's reference count,
        but buffer referencing is an important concept to know.

      &GStreamer; uses a type system to ensure that the data passed between
      elements is in a recognized format. The type system is also important for
      ensuring that the parameters required to fully specify a format match up
      correctly when connecting pads between elements. Each connection that is
      made between elements has a specified type.
