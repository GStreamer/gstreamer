  <title>Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo)</title>
  <para>
    Tags are pieces of information stored in a stream that are not the content
    itself, butthey rather <emphasis>describe</emphasis> the content. Most
    media container formats support tagging in one way or another. Ogg uses
    VorbisComment for this, MP3 uses ID3, AVI and WAV use RIFF's INFO list
    chunk, etc. GStreamer provides a general way for elements to read tags from
    the stream and expose this to the user. The tags (at least the metadata)
    will be part of the stream inside the pipeline. The consequence of this is
    that transcoding of files from one format to another will automatically
    preserve tags, as long as the input and output format elements both support
    tagging.
  </para>
  <para>
    Tags are separated in two categories in GStreamer, even though applications
    won't notice anything of this. The first are called <emphasis>metadata</emphasis>,
    the second are called <emphasis>streaminfo</emphasis>. Metadata are tags
    that describe the non-technical parts of stream content. They can be
    changed without needing to re-encode the stream completely. Examples are
    <quote>author</quote>, <quote>title</quote> or <quote>album</quote>. The
    container format might still need to be re-written for the tags to fit in,
    though. Streaminfo, on the other hand, are tags that describe the stream
    contents technically. To change them, the stream needs to be re-encoded.
    Examples are <quote>codec</quote> or <quote>bitrate</quote>. Note that some
    container formats (like ID3) store various streaminfo tags as metadata in
    the file container, which means that they can be changed so that they don't
    match the content in the file anymore. Still, they are called metadata
    because <emphasis>technically</emphasis>, they can be changed without
    re-encoding the whole stream, even though that makes them invalid. Files
    with such metadata tags will have the same tag twice: once as metadata,
    once as streaminfo.
  </para>
  <para>
    A tag reading element is called <classname>TagGetter</classname> in
    &GStreamer;. A tag writer is called <classname>TagSetter</classname>. An
    element supporting both can be used in a tag editor for quick tag changing.
