  <title>Tagging (Metadata and Streaminfo)</title>

  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
    Tags are pieces of information stored in a stream that are not the content
    itself, but they rather <emphasis>describe</emphasis> the content. Most
    media container formats support tagging in one way or another. Ogg uses
    VorbisComment for this, MP3 uses ID3, AVI and WAV use RIFF's INFO list
    chunk, etc. GStreamer provides a general way for elements to read tags from
    the stream and expose this to the user. The tags (at least the metadata)
    will be part of the stream inside the pipeline. The consequence of this is
    that transcoding of files from one format to another will automatically
    preserve tags, as long as the input and output format elements both support
    tagging.
  </para>
  <para>
    Tags are separated in two categories in GStreamer, even though applications
    won't notice anything of this. The first are called <emphasis>metadata</emphasis>,
    the second are called <emphasis>streaminfo</emphasis>. Metadata are tags
    that describe the non-technical parts of stream content. They can be
    changed without needing to re-encode the stream completely. Examples are
    <quote>author</quote>, <quote>title</quote> or <quote>album</quote>. The
    container format might still need to be re-written for the tags to fit in,
    though. Streaminfo, on the other hand, are tags that describe the stream
    contents technically. To change them, the stream needs to be re-encoded.
    Examples are <quote>codec</quote> or <quote>bitrate</quote>. Note that some
    container formats (like ID3) store various streaminfo tags as metadata in
    the file container, which means that they can be changed so that they don't
    match the content in the file any more. Still, they are called metadata
    because <emphasis>technically</emphasis>, they can be changed without
    re-encoding the whole stream, even though that makes them invalid. Files
    with such metadata tags will have the same tag twice: once as metadata,
    once as streaminfo.
  </para>
  <para>
    There is no special name for tag reading elements in &GStreamer;. There are
    specialised elements (e.g. id3demux) that do nothing besides tag reading,
    but any  &GStreamer; element may extract tags while processing data, and
    most decoders, demuxers and parsers do.
  </para>
  <para>
    A tag writer is called <ulink type="http"
    url="../../gstreamer/html/GstTagSetter.html"><classname>TagSetter</classname></ulink>.
    An element supporting both can be used in a tag editor for quick tag
    changing (note: in-place tag editing is still poorly supported at the time
    of writing and usually requires tag extraction/stripping and remuxing of
    the stream with new tags).

  <sect1 id="section-tagging-read" xreflabel="Reading Tags from Streams">
    <title>Reading Tags from Streams</title>
    <para>
      The basic object for tags is a <ulink type="http"
      url="../../gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstTagList.html"><classname>GstTagList
      </classname></ulink>. An element that is reading tags from a stream should
      create an empty taglist and fill this with individual tags. Empty tag
      lists can be created with <function>gst_tag_list_new ()</function>. Then,
      the element can fill the list using <function>gst_tag_list_add ()
      </function> or <function>gst_tag_list_add_values ()</function>.
      Note that elements often read metadata as strings, but the
      values in the taglist might not necessarily be strings - they need to be
      of the type the tag was registered as (the API documentation for each
      predefined tag should contain the type). Be sure to use functions like
      <function>gst_value_transform ()</function>
      to make sure that your data is of the right type. After data reading, the
      application can be notified of the new taglist by calling
      <function>gst_element_found_tags ()</function> or
      <function>gst_element_found_tags_for_pad ()</function> (if they only
      refer to a specific sub-stream). These functions will post a tag message
      on the pipeline's GstBus for the application to pick up, but also send
      tag events downstream, either over all source pad or the pad specified.
    </para>
    <para>
      We currently require the core to know the GType of tags before they are
      being used, so all tags must be registered first.  You can add new tags
      to the list of known tags using <function>gst_tag_register ()</function>.
      If you think the tag will be useful in more cases than just your own
      element, it might be a good idea to add it to <filename>gsttag.c</filename>
      instead. That's up to you to decide. If you want to do it in your own
      element, it's easiest to register the tag in one of your class init
      functions, preferrably <function>_class_init ()</function>.

    <title>Writing Tags to Streams</title>
    <para>
      Tag writers are the opposite of tag readers. Tag writers only take
      metadata tags into account, since that's the only type of tags that have
      to be written into a stream. Tag writers can receive tags in three ways:
      internal, application and pipeline. Internal tags are tags read by the
      element itself, which means that the tag writer is - in that case - a tag
      reader, too. Application tags are tags provided to the element via the
      TagSetter interface (which is just a layer). Pipeline tags are tags
      provided to the element from within the pipeline. The element receives
      such tags via the <symbol>GST_EVENT_TAG</symbol> event, which means
      that tags writers should automatically be event aware. The tag writer is
      responsible for combining all these three into one list and writing them
      to the output stream.
    </para>
    <para>
      The example below will receive tags from both application and pipeline,
      combine them and write them to the output stream. It implements the tag
      setter so applications can set tags, and retrieves pipeline tags from
      incoming events.

      Note that normally, elements would not read the full stream before
      processing tags. Rather, they would read from each sinkpad until they've
      received data (since tags usually come in before the first data buffer)
      and process that.
