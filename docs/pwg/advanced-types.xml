<chapter id="chapter-building-types">
  <title>Types and Properties</title>
  <para>
    There is a very large set of possible types that may be used to pass data
    between elements. Indeed, each new element that is defined may use a new
    data format (though unless at least one other element recognises that
    format, it will be most likely be useless since nothing will be able to
    link with it).
  </para>
  <para>
    In order for types to be useful, and for systems like autopluggers to
    work, it is neccessary that all elements agree on the type definitions,
    and which properties are required for each type. The &GStreamer; framework
    itself simply provides the ability to define types and parameters, but
    does not fix the meaning of types and parameters, and does not enforce
    standards on the creation of new types. This is a matter for a policy to
    decide, not technical systems to enforce.
  </para>
  <para>
    For now, the policy is simple:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Do not create a new type if you could use one which already exists.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If creating a new type, discuss it first with the other &GStreamer;
          developers, on at least one of: IRC, mailing lists, the &GStreamer;
          wiki.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Try to ensure that the name for a new format is as unlikely to
          conflict with anything else created already, and is not a more
          generalised name than it should be. For example: "audio/compressed"
          would be too generalised a name to represent audio data compressed
          with an mp3 codec. Instead "audio/mp3" might be an appropriate name,
          or "audio/compressed" could exist and have a property indicating the
          type of compression used.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Ensure that, when you do create a new type, you specify it clearly,
          and get it added to the list of known types so that other developers
          can use the type correctly when writing their elements.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

    <title>Building a Simple Format for Testing</title>
    <para>
      If you need a new format that has not yet been defined in our <xref
      linkend="section-types-definitions"/>, you will want to have some general
      guidelines on mimetype naming, properties and such. A mimetype would
      ideally be one defined by IANA; else, it should be in the form
      type/x-name, where type is the sort of data this mimetype handles (audio,
      video, ...) and name should be something specific for this specific type.
      Audio and video mimetypes should try to support the general audio/video
      properties (see the list), and can use their own properties, too. To get
      an idea of what properties we think are useful, see (again) the list.
    </para>
    <para>
      Take your time to find the right set of properties for your type. There
      is no reason to hurry. Also, experimenting with this is generally a good
      idea. Experience learns that theoretically thought-out types are good,
      but they still need practical use to assure that they serve their needs.
      Make sure that your property names do not clash with similar properties
      used in other types. If they match, make sure they mean the same thing;
      properties with different types but the same names are
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> allowed.

  <sect1 id="section-types-typefind" xreflabel="Typefind Functions and Autoplugging">
    <title>Typefind Functions and Autoplugging</title>
    <para>
      With only <emphasis>defining</emphasis> the types, we're not yet there.
      In order for a random data file to be recognized and played back as
      such, we need a way of recognizing their type out of the blue. For this
      purpose, <quote>typefinding</quote> was introduced. Typefinding is the
      process of detecting the type of a datastream. Typefinding consists of
      two separate parts: first, there's an unlimited number of functions
      that we call <emphasis>typefind functions</emphasis>, which are each
      able to recognize one or more types from an input stream. Then,
      secondly, there's a small engine which registers and calls each of
      those functions. This is the typefind core. On top of this typefind
      core, you would normally write an autoplugger, which is able to use
      this type detection system to dynamically build a pipeline around an
      input stream. Here, we will focus only on typefind functions.
    </para>
    <para>
      A typefind function ususally lives in
      <filename>gst-plugins/gst/typefind/gsttypefindfunctions.c</filename>,
      unless there's a good reason (like library dependencies) to put it
      elsewhere. The reason for this centralization is to decreate the
      number of plugins that need to be loaded in order to detect a stream's
      type. Below is an example that will recognize AVI files, which start
      with a <quote>RIFF</quote> tag, then the size of the file and then an
      <quote>AVI </quote> tag:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
static void
gst_my_typefind_function (GstTypeFind *tf,
			  gpointer     data)
{
  guint8 *data = gst_type_find_peek (tf, 0, 12);

  if (data &amp;&amp;
      GUINT32_FROM_LE ((guint32 *) data)[0] == GST_MAKE_FOURCC ('R','I','F','F') &amp;&amp;
      GUINT32_FROM_LE ((guint32 *) data)[2] == GST_MAKE_FOURCC ('A','V','I',' ')) {
    gst_type_find_suggest (tf, GST_TYPE_FIND_MAXIMUM,
			   gst_caps_new_simple ("video/x-msvideo", NULL));
  }
}

static gboolean
plugin_init (GstPlugin *plugin)
{
  static gchar *exts[] = { "avi", NULL };
  if (!gst_type_find_register (plugin, "", GST_RANK_PRIMARY,
			       gst_my_typefind_function, exts,
			       gst_caps_new_simple ("video/x-msvideo",
						    NULL), NULL))
    return FALSE;
}
    </programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that
      <filename>gst-plugins/gst/typefind/gsttypefindfunctions.c</filename>
      has some simplification macros to decrease the amount of code. Make
      good use of those if you want to submit typefinding patches with new
      typefind functions.

        Below is a list of all the defined types in &GStreamer;. They are split
        up in separate tables for audio, video, container, subtitle and other
        types, for the sake of readability. Below each table might follow a
        list of notes that apply to that table. In the definition of each type,
        we try to follow the types and rules as defined by <ulink type="http"

      <para>
        Note that many of the properties are not <emphasis>required</emphasis>,
        but rather <emphasis>optional</emphasis> properties. This means that
        most of these properties can be extracted from the container header,
        but that - in case the container header does not provide these - they
        can also be extracted by parsing the stream header or the stream
        content. The policy is that your element should provide the data that
        it knows about by only parsing its own content, not another element's
        content. Example: the AVI header provides samplerate of the contained
        audio stream in the header. MPEG system streams don't. This means that
        an AVI stream demuxer would provide samplerate as a property for MPEG
        audio streams, whereas an MPEG demuxer would not. A decoder needing
        this data would require a stream parser in between two extract this
        from the header or calculate it from the stream.

              rightly - will decrease latency. Note that some people think that
              this property is very ugly, whereas others think it is vital for
              the use of &GStreamer; in professional audio applications.

              The layout defines the packing of the samples in the stream. In

              This number of samples differs per format, hence the different
