Caps
----

Caps are lighweight refcounted objects describing media types.
They are composed of an array of GstStructures.

Caps are exposed on GstPadTemplates to describe all possible types a
given pad can handle. They are also stored in the registry along with
a description of the element.

Caps are exposed on the element pads using the _get_caps() pad function.
This function describes the possible types that the pad can handle or
produce (see part-pads.txt and part-negotiation.txt).

Caps are also attached to buffers to describe to content of the data
pointed to be the buffer.

Various methods exist to work with the media types such as substracting
or intersecting.
