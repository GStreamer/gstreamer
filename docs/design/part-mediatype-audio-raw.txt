   of valid sample formats.

  rate, G_TYPE_INT, mandatory
   The samplerate of the audio

  channels, G_TYPE_INT, mandatory
   The number of channels

  channel-mask, GST_TYPE_BITMASK, mandatory for more than 2 channels
   Bitmask of channel positions present. May be omitted for mono and
   stereo. May be set to 0 to denote that the channels are unpositioned.

  layout, G_TYPE_STRING, mandatory
   The layout of channels within a buffer. Possible values are
   "interleaved" (for LRLRLRLR) and "non-interleaved" (LLLLRRRR)

Use GstAudioInfo and related helper API to create and parse raw audio caps.
