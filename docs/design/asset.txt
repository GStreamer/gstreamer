Assets
~~~~~~~~~

This draft document describes a possible design for asset objects.

The assets should be used in order to instantiate objects of differents
types.

Terminology: A asset is an object from which objects can be extracted.

1. Basic ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, asset is a way of avoiding duplicating data between object and avoid
processing when the same processing would happen several times for an 2 different
objects of a same type.

    * There will be a listing of avalaible, ready to use assets
    * Asset allow to create some particular types of object that implement the GESExtractable
      interface
    * Assets will hold metadatas
    * Assets can be either, created by the user, or will be created by GES itself
      when initializing, there should be a way to disable that feature on demand.

Some ideas of asset(especially for TimelineSource objects) can be found in docs/random/design.

2. Problems (Not in any particular order)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1) We have avoid to various times the same file on the system
    2) We must be able to query assets by some criteria
        a. By type of TimelineObject that it can produce
        b. By type of supported tracks
        c. Should we have filters by some specific properties of source asset
           - like duration, width, height, etc?
    3) We must be able to get reference to origin asset of any extracted object
    4) We need a way to describe projects
    5) GESAssets can be instantiated asynchronously
    6) The instantiation of a asset can fail
    7) Users need to get informations about the instantiation failures
    8) User should be able to cancel the creation of a GESAsset (especially
       in case of asynchronous Asset creation)

3. Propositions to solve those problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1) We should have an interface that needs to be implemented by classes that need to be extractable.
       We can call it GESExtractable. It should be responsible for:
          * letting the user get the Asset from which an extracted object comes from
          * Making it possible to instantiate a GESAsset only from a GType which means that:
              - It needs to contain a reference to a GES_TYPE_ASSET (or subclass) so the proper GESAsset type will be instantiated.
              - It need to contain some mapping between the ID (string) of the asset, and the property of the object that is used as its ID.
                For a property to be usable as an ID for its asset, each objects extracted from a same asset must have the same value for the property
                Examples:
                    GESTimelineFileSource -> URI
                    GESTrackParseLaunchEffect -> bin_description
                    GESProject -> project name / uri of the stored serialized

    2) A list of all available, ready to be used assets should be cached  and
       reused whenever it is possible.
       Basically it will look like:
          GESAsset.id -> asset
       (the ID is computed thanks to the mapping)

    4) To allow users to implement some sort of library (media, effects, transitions...)
       we must be able to query assets by using some criteria,
        e.g. GType of the extractable object, URI, supported track types, etc...

    5) We can instantiate a GESAsset only from a GType, the appropriate checks need
       to be done and it can return subclasses of GESAsset thanks to the
       information included in the GESExtractable interface.

    6) Instanciation can happen asyncronously in some cases. For example, a
       asset that  needs to discover a file to be properly filled needs.

4. Use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    UC-1. Define media files and discover them
    UC-2. Define project - reference all assets
    UC-3. Define titles
    UC-4. Define operations
        - Transitions - 1 asset per transition type
        - Effects - 1 asset per effects type
        - TextOverlay
    UC-5. Handle metadata
    UC-6. Add operations (only effects?) to a GESTimelineObject
    UC-7. User want to 'invent' a new operation, we need to be able
          to let him define it
    UC-8. The user want to make an object from a GESAsset
