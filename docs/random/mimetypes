MIME types in GStreamer

What is a MIME type ?
=====================

A MIME type is a combination of two (short) strings (words)---the content type
and the content subtype. Content types are broad categories used for describing
almost all types of files: video, audio, text, and application are common
content types. The subtype further breaks the content type down into a more
specific type description, for example 'application/ogg', 'audio/raw',
'video/mpeg', or 'text/plain'.

So the content type and subtype make up a pair that describes the type of
information contained in a file. In multimedia processing, MIME types are used
to describe the type of information carried by a media stream. In GStreamer, we
use MIME types in the same way, to identify the types of information that are
allowed to pass between GStreamer elements. The MIME type is part of a GstCaps
object that describes a media stream. Besides a MIME type, a GstCaps object also
contains a name and some stream properties (GstProps, which hold combinations of
key/value pairs).

An example of a MIME type is 'video/mpeg'. A corresponding GstCaps could be
created using code:

GstCaps *caps = gst_caps_new_simple ("video/mpeg",
				     "width",  G_TYPE_INT, 384,
				     "height", G_TYPE_INT, 288,
				     NULL);

MIME types and their corresponding properties are of major importance in
GStreamer for uniquely identifying media streams. Therefore, we define them
per media type. All GStreamer plugins should keep to this definition.

Official MIME media types are assigned by the IANA. Current assignments are at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/.

The problems
============

Some streams may have MIME types or GstCaps that do not fully describe the
stream. In most cases, this is not a problem, though. For example, if a stream
contains Ogg/Vorbis data (which is of type 'application/ogg'), we don't need to
know the samplerate of the raw audio stream, since we can't play the encoded
audio anyway. The samplerate is, however, important for raw audio, so a decoder
would need to retrieve the samplerate from the Ogg/Vorbis stream headers (the
headers are part of the bytestream) in order to pass it on in the GstCaps that
belongs to the decoded audio (which becomes a type like 'audio/raw'). However,
other plugins might want to know such properties, even for compressed streams.
One such example is an AVI muxer, which does want to know the samplerate of an
audio stream, even when it is compressed.

Another problem is that many media types can be defined in multiple ways. For
example, MJPEG video can be defined as 'video/jpeg', 'video/mjpeg',
'image/jpeg', 'video/x-msvideo' with a compression of (fourcc) MJPG, etc.
None of these is really official, since there isn't an official mimetype
for encoded MJPEG video.

The main focus of this document is to propose a standardized set of MIME types
and properties that will be used by the GStreamer plugins.

Different types of streams
==========================

There are several types of media streams. The most important distinction will be
container formats, audio codecs and video codecs. Container formats are
bytestreams that contain one or more substreams inside it, and don't provide any
direct media data itself. Examples are Quicktime, AVI or MPEG System Stream.
They mostly contain of a set of headers that define the media streams that are
packed inside the container, along with the media data itself.

Video codecs and audio codecs describe encoded audio or video data. Examples are
MPEG-1 video, DivX video, MPEG-1 layer 3 (MP3) audio or Ogg/Vorbis audio.
Actually, Ogg is a container format too (for Vorbis audio), but these are
usually used in conjunction with each other.

Finally, there are the somewhat obvious (but not commonly encountered as files)
raw data formats.

Please note that we try to keep these MIME types as similar as possible to the
MIME types used as standards in Gnome (Gnome-VFS/Nautilus) and KDE
(Konqueror). Both will (in future) stick to a shared-mime-info database that
is hosted on freedesktop.org, and bases itself on IANA.

Also, there is a very thin line between audio codecs and audio containers
(take mp3 vs. sid, etc.). This is just a per-case thing right now and needs to
be documented further.

           bytestream. For the others, refer to technical documentation. We

Raw formats
-----------

Raw formats contain unencoded, raw media information. These are rather rare from
an end user point of view since raw media files have historically been
prohibitively large ... hence the multitude of encoding formats.

Raw video formats require the following common properties, in addition to
format-specific properties:

width = 1 - MAXINT (INT)
height = 1 - MAXINT (INT)

1 - Raw Video (YUV/YCbCr)
    MIME type: video/x-raw-yuv
    Properties: 'format' = 'XXXX' (fourcc)
    Known fourccs: YUY2, I420, Y41P, YVYU, UYVY, etc.
    Properties:

    Some raw video formats have implicit alignment rules. We should discuss this
    more. Also, some formats have multiple fourccs (e.g. IYUV/I420 or
    YUY2/YUYV). For each of these, we only use one (e.g. I420 and YUY2).

    Currently recognized formats:

    YUY2: packed, Y-U-Y-V order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
    YVYU: packed, Y-V-Y-U order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
    UYVY: packed, U-Y-V-Y order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
    Y41P: packed, UYVYUYVYYYYY order, U/V hor 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:1, 12 bpp)
    IUY2: packed, U-Y-V order, not subsampled (YUV-1:1:1, 24 bpp)

    Y42B: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:2, 16 bpp)
    YV12: planar, Y-V-U order, U/V hor+ver 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:0, 12 bpp)
    I420: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor+ver 2x subsampled (YUV-4:2:0, 12 bpp)
    Y41B: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:1, 12bpp)
    YUV9: planar, Y-U-V order, U/V hor+ver 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:0, 9bpp)
    YVU9: planar, Y-V-U order, U/V hor+ver 4x subsampled (YUV-4:1:0, 9bpp)

    Y800: one-plane (Y-only, YUV-4:0:0, 8bpp)

    See http://www.fourcc.org/ for more information.

    Note: YUV-4:4:4 (both planar and packed, in multiple orders) are missing.

2 - Raw video (RGB)
    MIME type: video/x-raw-rgb
    Properties: endianness = 1234/4321 (INT) <- use G_LITTLE/BIG_ENDIAN
                depth = 15/16/24 (INT, color depth)
                bpp = 16/24/32 (INT, bits used to store each pixel)
                red_mask = bitmask (0x..) (INT)
                green_mask = bitmask (0x..) (INT)
                blue_mask = bitmask (0x..) (INT)

    24 and 32 bit RGB should always be specified as big endian, since any little
    endian format can be transformed into big endian by rearranging the color
    masks. 15 and 16 bit formats should generally have the same byte order as
    the CPU.

    Color masks are interpreted by loading 'bpp' number of bits using the given
    'endianness', and masking and shifting by each color mask. Loading a 24-bit
    value cannot be done directly, but one can perform an equivalent operation.

    Examples:
               msb .. lsb
      - memory: RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG ...
                bpp        = 24
                depth      = 24
                endianness = 4321 (G_BIG_ENDIAN)
                red_mask   = 0xff0000
                green_mask = 0x00ff00
                blue_mask  = 0x0000ff

      - memory: xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG ...
                bpp        = 16
                depth      = 15
                endianness = 4321 (G_BIG_ENDIAN)
                red_mask   = 0x7c00
                green_mask = 0x03e0
                blue_mask  = 0x003f

      - memory: GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB xRRRRRGG GGGBBBBB ...
                bpp        = 16
                depth      = 15
                endianness = 1234 (G_LITTLE_ENDIAN)
                red_mask   = 0x7c00
                green_mask = 0x03e0
                blue_mask  = 0x003f

The raw audio formats require the following common properties, in addition to
format-specific properties:

rate = 1 - MAXINT (INT, sampling rate)
channels = 1 - MAXINT (INT, number of audio channels)
endianness = 1234/4321 (INT) <- use G_BIG/LITTLE_ENDIAN

3 - Raw audio (integer format)
    MIME type: audio/x-raw-int
    properties: width = 8/16/32 (INT, bits used to store each sample)
                depth = 8 - 32 (INT, bits actually used per sample)
                signed = TRUE/FALSE (BOOLEAN)

4 - Raw audio (floating point format)
    MIME type: audio/x-raw-float
    Properties: width = 32/64 (INT)
                buffer-frames: number of audio frames per buffer, 0=undefined

Plugin Guidelines
=================

So, a short bit on what plugins should do. Above, I've stated that audio
properties like 'channels' and 'rate' or video properties like 'width' and
'height' are all optional. This doesn't mean you can just simply omit them and
everything will still work!

An example is the best way to explain all this. AVI needs the width, height,
rate and channels for the AVI header. So if these properties are missing, the
avimux element cannot properly create the AVI header. On the other hand, MPEG
doesn't have such properties in its header, so the mpegdemux element would need
to parse the separate streams in order to find them out. We don't want that
either, because a plugin only does one job. So normally, mpegdemux and avimux
wouldn't allow transcoding. To solve this problem, there are stream parser
elements (such as mpegaudioparse, ac3parse and mpeg1videoparse).

Conclusions to draw from here: a plugin gives info it can provide as seen from
its own task/job. If it can't, other elements might still need it and a stream
parser needs to be written if it doesn't already exist.

On properties that can be described by one of these (properties such as 'width',
'height', 'fps', etc.): they're forbidden and should be handled using filtered
caps.

Status of this document
=======================

Not all plugins strictly follow these guidelines yet, but these are the official
types. Plugins not following these specs either use extensions that should be
documented, or are buggy (and should be fixed).
