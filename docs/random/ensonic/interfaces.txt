* new general interfaces
  * GST_TYPE_PRESET_MANAGER
    - add preset managment
    - API:
      GList *get_presets();
      void activate_preset_by_index(glong index);
      void activate_preset_by_name(const gchar *name);
      void add_current(const gchar *name);
      void remove_preset_by_index(glong index);
      void remove_preset_by_name(const gchar *name);
    - features
      - there should always be a default preset
    - questions
      - were and how do we store the presets?

  * GST_TYPE_UI_HINT
    - add hints to generate 'good' looking interfaces to elements
    - API:
      GList *get_group_list()
    - features
      - grouping of parameters
        - each group has a label and references a list of dparams or properties
    - question
      - should this be aware of instruments (voice-groups)
      - do we better use this to tell that a frequency is infact a note

* new interfaces for audio applications
  * GST_TYPE_MUSIC_GENERATOR
    - add hints so that application can use a element as an instrument
    - API:
      DParam *get_note_dparam();
      GList *get_trigger_dparams();
      char *get_number_of_voices_property();
      GList *get_global_param_names();
      GList *get_voice_param_names();
    - features
      - find out which params to use to play notes/trigger sounds
        - these params will not appear in a control-ui
        - notes involve a key to frequency translation
      - find out if the element has a number_of_voices property
        - if yes, we can find out about the max by looking at the gparamspec
        - setting the property, adds/removes voices
        - if the element supports it, it needs to:
          - register voice-dparams as e.g. note_XXX, where XXX is the voice-number
          - run the voice-loop in the chain/loop function
            each voice processes the same input, if at all
            the outputs of all voices are mixed together
