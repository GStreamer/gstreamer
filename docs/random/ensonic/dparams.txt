* cleanup of dparams
  * even though it is long try to stick to the prefix "dparam" for the whole library
      * e.g. avoid namespace clashes with "dataprotocol" which is using "dp" as well :-(
  * resolve g_return_if_fail() into GST_WARNING and return()
    in cases where the caller has to handle the problem
  * rename
    GST_TYPE_DPSMOOTH to GST_TYPE_DPARAM_SMOOTH
    GST_TYPE_DP_LININT to GST_TYPE_DPARAM_LININT
    there seems to be nobody using them, as they still look unfinished
  * move modes into extra modules
    dparam_mode_synchronous
    dparam_mode_asynchronous
    dparam_mode_disabled

* documentation
  * state of unitconvert
  * state of sychronous params

* concept for global, voice params
