This is a list of things to check in elements.



1. Add a "Element-Checklist-Version: 1" comment

This comment is to indicate which items on this checklist have been
checked, so that future checkers can skip things that you've already
carefully checked.  This number should obviously be updated whenever
you do additional checks.  Ideally, you should not do checks out of
order, but using "1, also 4-6" is acceptable.


2. Each pad should have a pad template

Create and register a pad template to the element class.


3. config.h

Make sure that each .c file includes config.h (conditionally on
HAVE_CONFIG_H).  Make sure that each .h file does _not_ include
config.h.





other ideas:

- plugins should avoid using gst_caps_to_string() in debug statement.
  They should use %"GST_PTR_FORMAT" instead.  Check all usage for leaks.
