=== Testing with monitors

Using gst-qa monitors is quite simple, there are 2 ways to test your
pipeline/element.

== Creating the monitors yourself
This method requires writing a specific application (or modifying yours) to
add GstQaMonitors and GstQaRunner to it. Create a GstQaRunner with
gst_qa_runner_new, then use gst_qa_monitor_factory_create to create monitors
for your pipeline.

Now all you have to do is use your pipeline as usual, the reports will be
created and posted to the runner. You can list them after the pipeline
finishes to look at the issues found.

== Using LD_PRELOAD and an existing application
If you want to test an already existing application without modifying it. Just
use:

LD_PRELOAD=path/to/libgstqa.so yourapp ...

gst-qa will try to replace GstPipeline creating functions and already
configure runners and monitors for you, reports will be printed to stdout when
they are found.


=== Using the file checker
The GstQaFileChecker is a convenient API to compare a media file properties
with its expected properties. The uri of the file to be tested and the
expected values can be configured via gobject properties.
gst_qa_file_checker_run is used to start the tests.

There is also a convenience tool (gst-qa-file-check) that can be used to
run the file checker.
