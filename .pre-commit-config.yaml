# Notes:
# - Python commands must be prefixed with `python` because pre-commit refuses to
#   special-case shebangs on Windows where `python3` does not commonly exists.
#   Luckily, the `python` command exists in the virtualenv created by pre-commit
#   on all platforms. https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/3415,
