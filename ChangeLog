	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-stream.c:
	  rtsp-stream: avoid deadlock in send_func
	  Currently the send_func() runs in a thread of its own which is started
	  the first time we enter handle_new_sample(). It runs in an outer loop
	  until priv->continue_sending is FALSE, which happens when a TEARDOWN
	  request is received. We use a local variable, cont, which is initialized
	  to TRUE, meaning that we will always enter the outer loop, and at the
	  end of the outer loop we assign it the value of priv->continue_sending.
	  Within the outer loop there is an inner loop, where we wait to be
	  signaled when there is more data to send. The inner loop is exited when
	  priv->send_cookie has changed value, which it does when more data is
	  available or when a TEARDOWN has been received.
	  But if we get a TEARDOWN before send_func() is entered we will get stuck
	  in the inner loop because no one will increase priv->session_cookie
	  anymore.
	  By not entering the outer loop in send_func() if priv->continue_sending
	  is FALSE we make sure that we do not get stuck in send_func()'s inner
	  loop should we receive a TEARDOWN before the send thread has started.

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-client.c:
	  rtsp-client: cleanup transports during TEARDOWN
	  When tunneling RTP over RTSP the stream transports are stored in a hash
	  table in the GstRTSPClientPrivate struct. They are used for, among other
	  things, mapping channel id to stream transports when receiving data from
	  the client. The stream tranports are created and added to the hash table
	  in handle_setup_request(), but unfortuately they are not removed in
	  handle_teardown_request(). This means that if the client sends data on
	  the RTSP connection after it has sent the TEARDOWN, which is often the
	  case when audio backchannel is enabled, handle_data() will still be able
	  to map the channel to a session transport and pass the data along to it.
	  Which eventually leads to a failing assert in gst_rtsp_stream_recv_rtp()
	  because the stream is no longer joined to a bin.
	  We avoid this by removing the stream transports from the hash table when
	  we handle the TEARDOWN request.

	  We don't unblock the stream anymore before replying to the
	  play request (883ddc72bb5bc57c95a9e167814d1ac53fe1b443),
	  so the sinks don't have a last-sample after potentially flush

	  the stream will block and wait for a first buffer. Subsequent

	  rtsp-media: do not unblock on unsuspend
	  rtsp_media_unsuspend() is called from handle_play_request()
	  before sending the play response. Unblocking the streams here
	  was causing data to be sent out before the client was ready
	  to handle it, with obvious side effects such as initial packets
	  getting discarded, causing decoding errors.
	  Instead we can simply let the media streams be unblocked when
	  the state of the media is set to PLAYING, which occurs after
	  sending the play response.

	  rtsp-media: Add/configure transports when completing the pipeline
	  Otherwise the transports are not set up yet during the PLAY request
	  handling when unsuspending (and thus unblocking) the media.
	  In case of live pipelines this then causes the first few packets to go
	  to the sinks before they know what to do with them, and they simply
	  discard them which is rather suboptimal in case of keyframes.
	  For non-live pipelines this is not a problem because the sink will still
	  be PAUSED and as such not send out the data yet but wait until it goes
	  to PLAYING, which is late enough.
	  Adding the transports multiple times is not a problem: if the transport
	  is already added it won't be added another time and TRUE will be
	  returned.
	  This fixes a regression introduced by a7732a68e8bc6b4ba15629c652056c240c624ff0

	* tests/check/meson.build:
	  tests: fix meson test env setup to make sure we use the right gst-plugin-scanner
	  If core is built as a subproject (e.g. as in gst-build), make sure to use
	  the gst-plugin-scanner from the built subproject. Without this, gstreamer
	  might accidentally use the gst-plugin-scanner from the install prefix if
	  that exists, which in turn might drag in gst library versions we didn't
	  mean to drag in. Those gst library versions might then be older than
	  what our current build needs, and might cause our newly-built plugins
	  to get blacklisted in the test registry because they rely on a symbol
	  that the wrongly-pulled in gst lib doesn't have.
	  This should fix running of unit tests in gst-build when invoking
	  meson test or ninja test from outside the devenv for the case where
	  there is an older or different-version gst-plugin-scanner installed
	  in the install prefix.
	  In case no gst-plugin-scanner is installed in the install prefix, this
	  will fix "GStreamer-WARNING: External plugin loader failed. This most
	  likely means that the plugin loader helper binary was not found or
	  could not be run. You might need to set the GST_PLUGIN_SCANNER
	  environment variable if your setup is unusual." warnings when running
	  the unit tests.
	  In the case where we find GStreamer core via pkg-config we use
	  a newly-added pkg-config var "pluginscannerdir" to get the right
	  directory. This has the benefit of working transparently for both
	  installed and uninstalled pkg-config files/setups.

	  Without this change there will be a race condition when using two or
	  more streams and rtsp-media receives a GstRTSPStreamBlocking message
	  from one of the streams. This is because rtsp-media then checks if all
	  streams are blocked by calling gst_rtsp_stream_is_blocking() for each

	  The commit "rtsp-client: define all seek accuracy flags from

	  Before that commit, having the flush flag set would result in a seek
	  (forced seek).
	  Even if no seek was needed. One reason to force seek is to flush old buffers
	  created in Describe requests.

	  Reverse playback support
	  GStreamer plays segment from stop to start when doing reverse playback.
	  RTSP implies that media should be played from start of Range header to
	  its stop. Hence we swap start and stop times before passing them to
	  gst_element_seek.
	  Also make gst_rtsp_stream_query_stop always return value that can be
	  used as stop time of Range header.

	  Also add unit test for this scenario.
	  The unit test simulate on a media level when two clients share a (live)
	  media.
	  Both clients have done SETUP and got responses. Now client 1 is doing
	  play and client 2 is just closing the connection.
	  Then without patch there are a problem when
	  client1 is calling gst_rtsp_media_unsuspend in handle_play_request.
	  And client2 is doing closing connection we can end up in a call
	  to gst_rtsp_media_set_state when
	  priv->status == GST_RTSP_MEDIA_STATUS_PREPARING and all the logic for
	  shut down media is jumped over .
	  With this patch and this scenario we wait until
	  priv->status == GST_RTSP_MEDIA_STATUS_PREPARED and then continue to
	  execute after that and now we will execute the logic for
	  shut down media.

	  rtsp-stream: Use seqnum-offset for rtpinfo
	  The sequence number in the rtpinfo is supposed to be the first RTP
	  sequence number. The "seqnum" property on a payloader is supposed to be
	  the number from the last processed RTP packet. The sequence number for
	  payloaders that inherit gstrtpbasepayload will not be correct in case of
	  buffer lists. In order to fix the seqnum property on the payloaders
	  gst-rtsp-server must get the sequence number for rtpinfo elsewhere and
	  "seqnum-offset" from the "stats" property contains the value of the
	  very first RTP packet in a stream. The server will, however, try to look
	  at the last simple in the sink element and only use properties on the
	  payloader in case there no sink elements yet, and by looking at the last
	  sample of the sink gives the server full control of which RTP packet it
	  looks at. If the payloader does not have the "stats" property, "seqnum"
	  is still used since "seqnum-offset" is only present in as part of
	  "stats" and this is still an issue not solved with this patch.

	  stream: Added a list of multicast client addresses
	  When media is shared, the same media stream can be sent
	  to multiple multicast groups. Currently, there is no API
	  to retrieve multicast addresses from the stream.
	  When calling gst_rtsp_stream_get_multicast_address() function,
	  only the first multicast address is returned.
	  With this patch, each multicast destination requested in SETUP
	  will be stored in an internal list (call to
	  gst_rtsp_stream_add_multicast_client_address()).
	  The list of multicast groups requested by the clients can be
	  retrieved by calling gst_rtsp_stream_get_multicast_client_addresses().
	  There still exist some problems with the current implementation
	  in the multicast case:
	  1) The receiving part is currently only configured with
	  regard to the first multicast client (see
	  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=796917).
	  2) Secondly, of security reasons, some constraints should be
	  put on the requested multicast destinations (see
	  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=796916).

	  rtsp-client: always allocate both IPV4 and IPV6 sockets
	  multiudpsink does not support setting the socket* properties
	  after it has started, which meant that rtsp-server could no
	  longer serve on both IPV4 and IPV6 sockets since the patches
	  from https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757488 were
	  merged.
	  When first connecting an IPV6 client then an IPV4 client,
	  multiudpsink fell back to using the IPV6 socket.
	  When first connecting an IPV4 client, then an IPV6 client,
	  multiudpsink errored out, released the IPV4 socket, then
	  crashed when trying to send a message on NULL nevertheless,
	  that is however a separate issue.
	  This could probably be fixed by handling the setting of
	  sockets in multiudpsink after it has started, that will
	  however be a much more significant effort.
	  For now, this commit simply partially reverts the behaviour
	  of rtsp-stream: it will continue to only create the udpsinks
	  when needed, as was the case since the patches were merged,
	  it will however when creating them, always allocate both
	  sockets and set them on the sink before it starts, as was
	  the case prior to the patches.
	  Transport configuration will only error out if the allocation
	  of UDP sockets fails for the actual client's family, this
	  also downgrades the GST_ERRORs in alloc_ports_one_family
	  to GST_WARNINGs, as failing to allocate is no longer
	  necessarily fatal.

	  Limit queued TCP data messages to one per stream
	  Before, the watch backlog size in GstRTSPClient was changed
	  dynamically between unlimited and a fixed size, trying to avoid both
	  unlimited memory usage and deadlocks while waiting for place in the
	  queue. (Some of the deadlocks were described in a long comment in
	  handle_request().)
	  In the previous commit, we changed to a fixed backlog size of 100.
	  This is possible, because we now handle RTP/RTCP data messages differently
	  from RTSP request/response messages.
	  The data messages are messages tunneled over TCP. We allow at most one
	  queued data message per stream in GstRTSPClient at a time, and
	  successfully sent data messages are acked by sending a "message-sent"
	  callback from the GstStreamTransport. Until that ack comes, the
	  GstRTSPStream does not call pull_sample() on its appsink, and
	  therefore the streaming thread in the pipeline will not be blocked
	  inside GstRTSPClient, waiting for a place in the queue.
	  pull_sample() is called when we have both an ack and a "new-sample"
	  signal from the appsink. Then, we know there is a buffer to write.
	  RTSP request/response messages are not acked in the same way as data
	  messages. The rest of the 100 places in the queue are used for
	  them. If the queue becomes full of request/response messages, we

	  rtsp-stream: avoid pushing data on unlinked udpsrc pad during setup
	  Fix race when setting up source elements.
	  Since we set the source element(s) to PLAYING state before hooking
	  them up to the downstream funnel, it's possible for the source element
	  to receive packets before we actually get to linking it to the funnel,
	  in which case buffers would be pushed out on an unlinked pad, causing
	  it to error out and stop receiving more data.
	  We fix this by blocking the source's srcpad until we have linked it.

	  the opposite, just like the ONVIF standard.
	  Let's follow those RFCs as we're doing RTSP here, and add a property at
	  a later time if needed to switch to the SDP RFC behaviour.

	  This was broken since the work for delayed transport creation
	  was merged: the creation of the transports string depends on
	  calling stream_get_server_port, which only starts returning
	  something meaningful after a call to stream_allocate_udp_sockets
	  has been made, this function expects a transport that we parse
	  from the transport string ...
	  Significant refactoring is in order, but does not look entirely
	  trivial, for now we put a band aid on and create a second transport
	  string after the stream has been completed, to pass it in
	  the request headers instead of the previous, incomplete one.

	  If a bin is passed as the custom payloader, the caps of
	  its factory will be empty, the correct way to obtain the caps
	  is to query its sinkpad.

	  This was a FIXME  item, and can be quite useful, also
	  allowing to specify payloader properties from the command
	  line, which is always nice.

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-media.c:
	* tests/check/gst/rtspclientsink.c:
	  rtsp-media: fix RECORD getting stuck
	  The test_record case was working because async=false had
	  been added in https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757488
	  but that was incorrect, as it should not be needed.
	  Removing async=false made the test fail as expected, this is
	  fixed by not trying to preroll when preparing the media for
	  RECORD, as start_prepare is called upon receiving ANNOUNCE,
	  and our peer will not start sending media until it has received
	  a response to that request, and sent and received a response
	  to RECORD as well, thus obviously preventing preroll.

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-onvif-media.c:
	  rtp-server: remove redefined variable
	  res is a boolean variable which is defined in the function scope and
	  redefined, with no reason, in the loop scope. This patch removes the
	  redefinition.
	  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=793592

	  stream: Add functions for checking if stream is receiver or sender
	  ...and replace all checks for RECORD in GstRTSPMedia which are really
	  for "sender-only". This way the code becomes more generic and introducing
	  support for onvif-backchannel later on will require no changes in
	  GstRTSPMedia.

2018-01-22 12:46:34 +0200  Sebastian Dröge <sebastian@centricular.com>

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-onvif-media.c:
	  rtsp-server: Switch around sendonly/recvonly attributes
	  They are wrong in the ONVIF streaming spec. The backchannel should be
	  recvonly and the normal media should be sendonly: direction is always
	  from the point of view of the SDP offerer (the server) according to
	  RFC 3264.

	  for handling the specifics of the backchannel. Ideally this later can be
	  extended with other ONVIF specific features.

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-media.c:
	  rtsp-media: Add support for sending+receiving medias
	  We need to add an appsrc/appsink in that case because otherwise the
	  media bin will be a sink and a source for rtpbin, causing a pipeline
	  loop.

	  85c52e194bcb81928b96614be0ae47d59eccb1ce introduced a more correct
	  detection of the srtp rollover counter to add to the SDP.
	  Unfortunately, it was incomplete for live pipelines where the logic
	  blocks the source bin before creating the SDP and thus would never have
	  the necessary informaiton to create a correct SDP with srtp encryption.
	  Move the pad blocks to rtpbin's output pads instead so that the
	  necessary information can be created before we need the information for
	  the SDP.

	  When using dynamic elements, gst_rtsp_stream_join_bin() is called from
	  "pad-added" signal. In that case priv->srcpad could already have its caps,
	  and they'll be sent to priv->send_src[0] pad. That means that when it
	  connects "notify::caps" signal, that pad could already have received its
	  caps and the signal won't be emitted anymore.
	  In that case priv->caps stay to NULL and when building the SDP that stream
	  gets ignored. Leading to missing video or audio when playing in client side.

	  because it was introducing various regressions:
	  - It introduces a leak of udpsrc elements that got wrongly fixed by adding
	  an hash table in commit cba045e. We should have at most 4 udpsrc for unicast:
	  ipv4/ipv6, rtp/rtcp. They can be reused for all unicast clients.
	  - If a mcast client connects, it creates a new socket in SETUP to try to respect
	  the destination/port given by the client in the transport, and overrides the
	  socket already set on the udpsink element. That means that if we already had a
	  client connected, the source address on the udp packets it receives suddenly
	  changes.
	  - If a 2nd mcast client connects, the destination/port in its transport is
	  ignored but its transport wasn't updated.
	  What this patch does:
	  - Revert back to create udpsrc/udpsink for unicast clients on DESCRIBE.
	  - Always have a tee+queue when udp is enabled. This could be optimized
	  again in a later patch, but is more complicated. If no unicast clients
	  connects then those elements are useless, this could be also optimized
	  in a later patch.
	  - When mcast transport is added, it creates a new set of udpsrc/udpsink,
	  seperated from those for unicast clients. Since we already support only
	  one mcast address, we also create only one set of elements.

	* pkgconfig/gstreamer-rtsp-server-uninstalled.pc.in:
	  uninstalled.pc: add support for non libtool build systems
	  Currently the .la path is provided which requires to use libtool as
	  mentioned in the GStreamer manual section-helloworld-compilerun.html.
	  It is fine as long as the application is built using libtool.
	  So currently it is not possible to compile a GStreamer application
	  within gst-uninstalled with CMake or other build system different
	  than autotools.
	  This patch allows to do the following in gst-uninstalled env:
	  gcc test.c -o test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0 \
	  gstreamer-rtsp-server-1.0)
	  Previously it required to prepend libtool --mode=link

	  Goto error label checks stream to see if it needs to be unreferenced before

	  Coverity demands for fallthrough statements to be clearly commented,

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-stream.c:
	  rtsp-stream: Only create RTP sending/receiving rtpbin pads if needed
	  Adding them when not needed will start some logic inside rtpbin that might be
	  problematic. Also if e.g. for a sender media we suddenly receive RTP data, we
	  would start up a rtpjitterbuffer and behave in weird ways.
	  We still set up the UDP sources for RTP receiving for a sender media to be
	  able to receive any packets sent by the client for NAT traversal. They will
	  all go to a fakesink though.
	  Having an rtpjitterbuffer in the media pipeline will cause the pipeline to be
	  NO_PREROLL, which will cause deadlocks when seeking the media as it will never
	  receive ASYNC_DONE after a seek.

	  This reverts commit 935e8f852d050b4939f1d0f44b38e9b55a2fbe36.
	  RFC 2326 states that session IDs may consist of alphanumeric as well as
	  the safe characters $-_.+ -- N.B. the percent character is not allowed.
	  Previously the session ID was URI-escaped, this meant that any character
	  which was not alphanumeric or any of the characters +-._~ would be
	  percent encoded. While the RFC (surprisingly) mentions that linear white
	  space in session IDs should be URI-escaped, it does not say anything
	  about other characters. Moreover no white space is allowed in the
	  session ID. Finally the percent character which is the result of
	  URI-escaping is not allowed in a session ID.
	  So there is no reason to do any URI-escaping, and now it is removed.

	  Allow the send backlog in the RTSP watch to grow to unlimited size while
	  attempting to bring the media pipeline to NULL due to a session
	  expiring.  Without this change the appsink element cannot change state
	  because it is blocked while rendering data in the new_sample callback.
	  This callback will block until it has successfully put the data into the
	  send backlog. There is a chance that the send backlog is full at this
	  point which means that the callback may block for a long time, possibly
	  forever. Therefore the media pipeline may also be prevented from
	  changing state for a long time.

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-client.c:
	  client: simplify session transport handling
	  link/unlink of the transport in a session was done to keep track of all
	  TCP transports and to send RTP/RTCP data to the streams. We can simplify
	  that by putting all the TCP transports in a hashtable indexed with the
	  channel number.
	  We also don't need to link/unlink the transports when we pause/resume
	  the streams. The same effect is already achieved when we pause/play the
	  media. Indeed, when we pause the media, the transport is removed from
	  the media and the callbacks will not be called anymore.

	  Move some methods inside the relevant object source code.
	  Use GPtrArray to store objects instead of plain arrays, it is more
	  natural and allows us to more easily clean up.
	  Move the allocation of udp ports to the Stream object. The Stream object
	  contains the elements needed to stream the media to a client.
	  Improve the prepare and unprepare methods. Unprepare should now undo
	  everything prepare did. Improve also async unprepare when doing EOS on
	  shutdown. Make sure we always unprepare correctly.

	  rtsp-media-factory: make ::get_element overridable by GI bindings
	  The way to annotate vfuncs with GI seems to be to create an invoker (GI term)
	  for them and to annotate the invoker. Add gst_rtsp_media_factory_get_element()
	  as the invoker for ::get_element(), making it overridable by GI generated
	  bindings.

	* gst/rtsp-server/rtsp-client.c:
	  client: destroy pipeline on client disconnect with no prior TEARDOWN.
	  The problem occurs when the client abruptly closes the connection without
	  issuing a TEARDOWN.  The TEARDOWN handler in the rtsp-client.c file of the RTSP
	  server is where the pipeline gets torn down.  Since this handler is not called,
	  the pipeline remains and is up and running.  Subsequent clients get their own
	  pipelines and if the do not issue TEARDOWNs then those pipelines will also
	  remain up and running.  This is a resource leak.
