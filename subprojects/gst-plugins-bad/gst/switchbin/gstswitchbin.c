/**
 * SECTION:element-switchbin
 * @title: switchbin
 *
 * switchbin is a helper element that chooses between a set of processing
 * chains (called "paths") based on incoming caps, the caps of the paths,
 * and the result of caps queries issued to the elements within the paths.
 * It switches between these paths based on thes caps. Paths are child objects,
 * which are accessed by the #GstChildProxy interface.
 *
 * The intent is to allow for easy construction of dynamic pipelines that
 * automatically switches between paths based on the caps, which is useful
 * for cases when certain elements are only to be used for certain types
 * of dataflow. One common example is a switchbin that inserts postprocessing
 * elements only if the incoming caps are of a type that allows for such
 * postprocessing, like when a video dataflow could be raw frames in some
 * cases and encoded MPEG video in others - postprocessing plugins for
 * color space conversion, scaling and such then should only be inserted
 * if the data consists of raw frames, while encoded video is passed
 * through unchanged.
 *
 * Each path has an "element" property. If a #GstElement is passed to this,
 * switchbin takes ownership over that element. (Any previously set element
 * is removed and unref'd before the new one is set.) The element property
 * can also be NULL for a special passthrough mode (see below). In addition,
 * each path has a "caps" property, which is used for finding matching
 * paths. These caps are referred to as the "path caps".
 *
 * NOTE: Currently, switchbin has a limitation that path elements must
 * have exactly one "sink" and one "src" pad, both of which need to be
 * always available, so no request and no sometimes pads.
 *
 * Whenever new input caps are encountered at the switchbin's sinkpad,
 * the first path with matching caps is picked. A "match" means that the
 * result of gst_caps_can_intersect() is TRUE. The paths are looked at
 * in order: path \#0's caps are looked at first, checked against the new
 * input caps with gst_caps_can_intersect(), and if the return value
 * is TRUE, path \#0 is picked. Otherwise, path \#1's caps are looked at etc.
 * If no path matches, a GST_STREAM_ERROR_WRONG_TYPE error is reported.
 *
 * For queries, the concept of "allowed caps" is important. These are the
 * caps that are possible to use with this switchbin. They are computed
 * differently for sink- and for srcpads.
 *
 * Allowed sinkpad caps are computed by visiting each path, issuing an
 * internal caps query to the path element's sink pad, intersecting the
 * result from that query with the path caps, and appending that intersection
 * to the overall allowed sinkpad caps. Allowed srcpad caps are similar,
 * except that the result of the internal query is directly attached to the
 * overall allowed srcpad caps (no intersection with path caps takes place):
 * The intuition behind this is that in sinkpad direction, only caps that
 * are compatible with both the path caps and whatever the internal element
 * can handle are really usable - other caps will be rejected. In srcpad
 * direction, path caps do not exert an influence.
 *
 * The switchbin responds to caps and accept-caps queries in a particular
 * way. They involve the aforementioned "allowed caps".
 *
 * Caps queries are responded to by first checking if there are any paths.
 * If num-paths is 0, the query always fails. If there is no current path
 * selected, or if the path has no element, the allowed sink/srcpad caps
 * (depending on whether the query comes from the sink- or srcpad direction)
 * is directly used as the response. If a current path is selected, and it
 * has an element, the query is forwarded to that element instead.
 *
 * Accept-caps queries are handled by checking if the switchbin can find
 * a path whose caps match the caps from that query. If there is one, the
 * response to that query is TRUE, otherwise FALSE.
 *
 * As mentioned before, path caps can in theory be any kind of caps. However,
 * they always only affect the input side (= the sink pad side of the switchbin).
 * Path elements can produce output of any type, so their srcpad caps can be
 * anything, even caps that are entirely different. For example, it is perfectly
 * valid if the path caps are "video/x-raw", the path element sink pad template
 * caps also are "video/x-raw", and the src pad caps of the elements are
 * "application/x-rtp".
 *
 * Path elements can be set to NULL. Such paths perform dataflow passthrough.
 * The path then just forwards data. This includes caps and accept-caps queries.
 * Since there is no element, the internal caps queries go to the switchbin
 * peers instead (to the upstream peer when the query is at the switchbin's
 * srcpad, and to the downstream peer if the query is at the sinkpad).
 *
 * <refsect2>
 * <title>Example launch line</title>
 *
 * In this example, if the data is raw PCM audio with 44.1 kHz, a volume
 * element is used for reducing the audio volume to 10%. Otherwise, it is
 * just passed through. So, 44.1 kHz PCM audio will sound quiet, while
 * 48 kHz PCM and any non-PCM data will be passed through unmodified.
 *
 * |[
 *   gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin uri=<URI> ! switchbin num-paths=2 \
 *     path0::element="audioconvert ! volume volume=0.1" path0::caps="audio/x-raw, rate=44100" \
 *     path1::caps="ANY" ! \
 *     autoaudiosink
 * ]|
 *
 * This example's path \#1 is a passthrough path. Its caps are "ANY" caps,
 * and its element is NULL (the default value). Dataflow is passed through,
 * and caps and accept-caps queries are forwarded to the switchbin peers.
 *
 * NOTE: Setting the caps to NULL instead of ANY would have accompl√≠shed
 * the same in this example, since NULL path caps are internally
 * interpreted as ANY caps.
