 * GstAnalyticsBatchBuffer:
 * @sticky_events: (nullable) (array length=n_sticky_events): All sticky #GstEvent that relate to this buffer
 * @n_sticky_events: Number of sticky events.
 * @serialized_events: (nullable) (array length=n_serialized_events): All non-sticky, serialized #GstEvent that arrived
 *                     after the previous and before this buffer
 * @n_serialized_events: Number of serialized events.
 * @buffer: (nullable): The buffer, if any.
 * @buffer_list: (nullable): The buffer list, if any.
 *
 * The intended use of this struct is that analytics elements read the buffer or
 * buffer list and potentially attach new #GstMeta with additional information.
 * Only one of @buffer or @buffer_list is going to be set, or both are %NULL.
 *
 * Elements that need to modify @buffer (e.g. to attach a new meta) must first
 * call gst_buffer_make_writable() and store the writable buffer in this struct.
 * Similarly, a writable @buffer_list must be ensured with
 * gst_buffer_list_make_writable().
 *
 * Modifying any other fields must be done with special care to ensure that the
 * data flow of the stream is not broken.
 *
 * It is possible for @buffer and @buffer_list to be %NULL, e.g. if there was no
 * buffer for this batch but there were serialized events like a gap event.
 *
 * Note that @serialized_events always contains all currently active serialized
 * events and not only the changed events compared to the previous buffer.

 * Since: 1.28

 * to reconstruct the original streams.
 *
 * When used for multiple streams and batching them temporarily, caps of type
 * `multistream/x-analytics-batch(meta:GstAnalyticsBatchMeta)` should be used,
 * with the original caps of each stream in an array-typed `streams` field. The
 * original caps of each stream might be extended by additional fields and the
 * order of the streams in the array corresponds to the order of the @streams
 * array of the meta. In this case, empty buffers would be used without any
 * #GstMemory and
 *
 * When used for a single stream, the original caps might be used together with
 * the `meta:GstAnalyticsBatchMeta` caps feature and potentially extended by
 * additional fields to describe the kind of batching and its configuration,
 * e.g. that each batch is made of 25% overlapping 320x320 slices of the
 * original video frame.
 *
 * The timestamp, duration and other metadata of each batch can be retrieved
