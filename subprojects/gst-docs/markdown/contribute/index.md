# Contributing to GStreamer

This document provides instructions and guidelines for submitting issues,
feature requests and patches to GStreamer. The following applies to all
these operations:

- Please use [freedesktop.org GitLab][gitlab] to perform any of the aforementioned
  operations. You will need to create a freedesktop.org GitLab account if you
  don't have one yet (yep, that's just how it is. Sorry for the inconvenience)
  If you don't want to create a new account you should also be able to sign in
  with a Google, GitHub or Twitter account.

- Due to an [influx of spam](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/wikis/home)
  user accounts on GitLab are restricted by default and can't fork projects,
  which is needed to create a Merge Request.

  Please [file an issue and fill in the User Verification template][user-verification]
  in order to get full access. Sorry for the hassle, and thanks for your
  understanding.

## How to File Issues and Request for Enhancements

### Where to File Issues and Feature Requests

- If your issue is security related, please see
  [GStreamer Security Center](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/) before
  continuing.

- Create a new issue if there is no existing report for this problem yet.
  The GStreamer [bugs page][bugs] also has shortcuts for the major components
  and simple search functionality if you'd like to browse or search for
  existing issues, or use the [GitLab search bar for the GStreamer project][gitlab]
  at the top of the page.

- If you are filing a feature request (i.e. anything that is not supposed to
  work already, that is anything not an issue), please add the *Enhancement* label.
  Feel free to add any other appropriate already existing labels. Please don't
  create new labels just for your issue. This won't affect the way we prioritise
  the issue, but it will make triaging easier for us. In particular, do not add
  the *Blocker* label to an issue just because an issue is important to you.
  This label should be added only by GStreamer maintainers.

- If your issue is about a specific plugin, element or utility library,
  please prefix the issue summary with `element-name:`, `plugin-name:` or `lib:`
  and keep the rest of the description as short and precise as possible.

  Examples:

   - `id3demux: fails to extract composer tags`
   - `tsdemux: does not detect audio stream`
   - `Internal flow error when playing matroska file`

  This makes sure developers looking through the list of open issues or issue
  notification mails can quickly identify what your issue is about. If your text
  is too long and only contains fill words at the beginning, the important
  information will be cut off and not show up in the list view or mail client.

- If you don't know which component to file the issue against, just pick the one
  that seems the most likely to you, or file it against the gstreamer-project
  component. If in doubt just pop into our [Matrix Discussion channel][matrix].
  In any case, if it's not the right component someone will move the issue once
  they have a better idea what the problem is and where it belongs.

- Please mention:

   - what version of GStreamer you are using
   - what operating system you are using (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - if you're on Linux, please mention your distro and distro version
   - if this is on an embedded device please provide details

- Try to describe how the issue can be reproduced. If it is triggered by any
  specific file, try to make the file available somewhere for download and
  put the link into the issue. The easier it is for us to reproduce
  the issue, the easier it is to fix it.

- If you experience a crash (that is: the application shuts down unexpectedly,
  usually with a segfault or bus error or memory access violation or such),
  please try to [obtain a stack trace][stack-trace]. If there are criticals
  or warnings printed right before the crash, run with the environment variable
  `G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings` set, then it will abort on the first warning, which
  should hopefully give an indication to where the problem is. You can then
  obtain a stack trace from where it aborts.

- If the application errors out, please provide a gst debug log. You can get
  one by setting the `GST_DEBUG=*:6` environment variable, combined with
  `GST_DEBUG_FILE=/tmp/dbg.log`. The resulting file might end up being very
  large, so it's advisable to compress it with `xz -9 /tmp/dbg.log` before
  sharing. You may also be asked to provide debug logs for specific debug
  categories rather than everything (`*:6`).

## How to Submit Patches

### Where to Submit Patches

Patches need to be submitted through [GitLab][gitlab] in form of a
"Merge Request" (MR), which is the same as a "Pull Request" (PR)
in GitHub, and uses the same [workflow][gitlab-merge-request-workflow].

[gitlab-merge-request-workflow]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/merge_requests/index.html#overview

In a nutshell, you will:

1. [Clone](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) the gstreamer repository on
   your development machine
1. Create a [fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html)
   of it in your gitlab namespace (you may have to obtain forking permission first)
1. Add that fork as a [git "remote"](https://github.com/git-guides/git-remote)
   to the clone on your machine
1. Setup a [branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/)
   with the commits you want to submit
1. Push that branch to the fork in your gitlab namespace
1. Open request to merge that branch into the main repository, which is called a
   [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)

#### Pre-requisites

In order to submit a merge request you must first:

1. Sign into or create an account on the [Freedesktop GitLab website](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org)
2. Setup SSH keys in the [GitLab user settings](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/profile/keys)
3. Clone the gstreamer repository on your development machine

#### Forking the gstreamer repository

Then you need to create a *personal* fork of gstreamer. To fork gstreamer go to
[the repository](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer) and hit
the "Fork" button:

![Forking gstreamer](images/contribute/fork-gstreamer.png)

Select the namespace (your username), ensure that the visibility is set to
"Public", and hit the "Fork project" button:

![Fork settings](images/contribute/fork-settings.png)

**Please note** that new gitlab accounts do not have permission to create forks by
default, so you will have to [first file an issue and fill in the user verification
template][user-verification] as mentioned above in order to get forking rights.
This should be a fairly quick process.

A new repository will be created in your user namespace
(<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer>). You will be redirected
there automatically once the forking process is finished. The forking might
take a few minutes.

Once this is done you can add your personal fork as new remote to the gstreamer
repository clone you made in step 3 above with the following command (replace
`$GITLAB_USERNAME` with your actual gitlab username):

    git remote add $GITLAB_USERNAME git@gitlab.freedesktop.org:$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer.git

Check with

    git fetch $GITLAB_USERNAME

that it is accessible and working.

Common mistakes at this point are:

a) [Not setting up an SSH key](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/profile/keys)

b) Having a private fork. You can change your fork to public in the settings:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer/edit (replace `$GITLAB_USERNAME`
with your actual gitlab username)

#### Setting up your branch

Next, you make a git branch with one or more commits you want to submit
for review and merging. For that you will first need a local branch which
you can create with e.g.

    git checkout -b fix-xyz

Then you can make your modifications and create a local commit with e.g.

    git commit path/to/file1.[ch]

This will pop up an editor where you can create your commit message. It should
look something like:

    exampledemux: fix seeking without index in push mode

    Without an index we would refuse to seek in push mode. Make
    seeking without an index work by estimating the position
    to seek to. It might not be 100% accurate, but better than
    nothing.

Then exit the editor, and you should have a commit.

Please make sure your commits are as terse and precise as possible. Do not
include 'clean-ups' or non-functional changes, since they distract from the
real changes and make things harder to review, and also lower the chances that
the patch will still apply cleanly to the latest version in git. If you feel
there are things to clean up, please submit the clean-ups as a separate patch
that does not contain any functional changes. See
[Writing Good Commit Messages](#writing-good-commit-messages) for more
information.

It's best to run `git add` or `git commit` on specific directories or files
instead of using `git commit -a`, as it's too easy to accidentally contaminate
a patch with changes that belong into it with `git commit -a`, in particular
changes to the `common` submodule.

You can check your commit(s) with `git show` or `git log -p` or using a GUI
such as `gitg` or `gitk`.

Make sure the author is correctly set to your full name and e-mail address.

If you haven't used git before, it would be a good idea to tell it who you are:

    git config --global user.name "George S. Treamer"
    git config --global user.email "george.s.treamer@example.com"

You can make changes to the last commit using:

 - `git commit --amend` to fix up the commit message

 - `git commit --amend --author='John You <john@you.com>'` to fix up the author

 - `git add path/to/file1.[ch]; git commit --amend` to incorporate fixes
    made to the files since the last commit (i.e. what shows up in `git diff`).
    If you just want to add some of the changes, but not all of them you can
    use `git add -p file.c`, then it will ask you for each individual change
    whether you want to add it or leave it.

Once everything looks fine, you can push the branch to your personal fork git
repository with:

    git push -u $GITLAB_USERNAME

You can use

    git push -u --dry-run $GITLAB_USERNAME

for testing to see what would happen without actually doing anything yet.
As before, replace `$GITLAB_USERNAME` with your actual gitlab username.

After you have pushed the branch to your personal fork you will see a link
on the terminal with which you can create a merge request for the upstream
repository. It will look something like this:

```sh
$ git push -u $GITLAB_USERNAME
Enumerating objects: 4436, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4436/4436), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads

Total 3616 (delta 2973), reused 3022 (delta 2443), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2973/2973), completed with 704 local objects.
remote:
remote: To create a merge request for fix-xyz, visit:

 * [new branch]            fix-xyz -> fix-xyz
Branch 'fix-xyz' set up to track remote branch 'fix-xyz' from '$GITLAB_USERNAME' by rebasing.
```

Clicking on that link will take you to a page where you can enter a description
of the changes you are submitting. If your branch contains only one commit, the
title and description will be auto-filled using the commit message.

![Submitting a merge request](images/contribute/submit-mr.png)

On the same page, ensure that these checkboxes are selected and create the
merge request:

![Merge request settings](images/contribute/mr-settings.png)

If you don't see the link or want to do this later, you can go to the branch
list of your personal repository at <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer/branches>
and hit the 'Merge Request' button when ready. This will open a new page where
you can select the source project `$GITLAB_USERNAME/gstreamer` + source branch
`fix-xyz` and the target project `gstreamer/gstreamer` and target branch
`main`. Then you will be able to enter a description of the changes you are
submitting.


#### Revising your merge request

You will often need to revise the commits in your merge request based on review
by maintainers of the project. You **do not** need to open a new merge request
to do that. You need to edit the commits in your local branch and force-push it
to sync the branch in your namespace. That will automatically update the merge
request.

The most common case is when you have a single commit in your branch that you
want to edit. To do this, first make any changes you want to do, then check the
branch status:

```sh
$ git status
On branch fix-xyz
Your branch is up to date with '$GITLAB_USERNAME/fix-xyz'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   subprojects/gst-docs/markdown/contribute/index.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Next, add the changes and amend your commit:

```sh
$ git add subprojects/gst-docs/markdown/contribute/index.md
$ git commit --amend
```

This will open your editor and allow you to edit the commit message if
necessary. Closing the editor will save the new (updated) commit.

Next, push the changes to your remote branch:

```sh
$ git push --force-with-lease
```

This will overwrite the old commit in your remote branch with the new commit
that you just created. If this command completes successfully, that's it! The
merge request has been automatically updated.

**If the command fails**, that means that there were changes in the remote
branch that you hadn't pulled into your branch before amending your commit.

This can happen if, for example, someone uses the "Rebase" button on your merge
request to rebase the commit(s) on top of the latest changes in the `main`
branch.

In that case you need to resync the two branches. This usually requires you to
understand `git rebase`, which is beyond the scope of this document. There's
tutorials you can find online, such as [git-rebase.io](https://git-rebase.io/)

In the simplest case, you might be able to get away with just doing a `git pull
--rebase`.

#### Additional points

- If you are submitting a Merge Request for an issue (or multiple issues) that
  already exist, please add 'Fixes #123' to the commit message of one of your
  commits, so that there is a cross-reference in GitLab and the issue will be
  closed automatically when your Merge Request is merged.

- You do not have to file an issue to go with each Merge Request, it's fine
  to just submit a Merge Request on its own.

- If your proposed changes are proposed for review but not ready to be merged
  yet, please prefix the Merge Request title with `WIP:` for Work-in-Progress.
  That will prevent us from inadvertently merging it and make clear its status.

- Please make sure the 'Author' field in your commit messages has your full and
  proper name and e-mail address. You can check with e.g. `git log` or `gitk`.

- If your change is for an enhancement (anything that is not supposed to work
  already, i.e. anything not a bug) or adds new API, please add the
  *Enhancement* label. This won't affect the way we prioritise your issue,
  but it does make triaging easier for us.

- If your Merge Request is against a specific plugin or element or utility library,
  please prefix the Merge Request summary with `element-name:`, `plugin-name:`
  or `lib:` and keep the rest of the description as short and precise as possible.

  Examples:

   - `id3demux: add support for WCOP frame`
   - `riff: add RGB16 support`
   - `playbin: detect if video-sink supports deinterlacing`
   - `tests: rtprtx unit test is racy`

  This makes sure developers looking through the list of open merge requests or
  notification mails can quickly identify what your change is about. If your text
  is too long and only contains fill words at the beginning, the important
  information will be cut off and not show up in the list view or mail client.

- Make liberal use of the reference syntax available to help cross-linking
  different issues and merge requests. e.g. `#100` references issue 100 in the
  current project, and `!100` references merge request 100 in the current project.
  A complete list is available from [gitlab's documentation][special-md-references].

- Please create separate merge requests for separate issues.
  There is no golden rule when something counts as a separate issue,
  please just use your best judgment.
  If there is an issue that requires related fixes in multiple elements
  or libraries, please also feel free to put everything into one issue. If you
  just happen to have multiple patches for us but they are not really related,
  please put them in separate issues and merge requests. The main question is
  if it makes sense to discuss and review these patches together or if they
  could just as well be handled completely separately.

- Please do not send patches to the gstreamer-devel mailing list. Patches
  submitted on the mailing list are most likely going to be ignored, overlooked,
  or you will get a brief reply asking you to put them into gitlab. We do
  not use the mailing list for patch review.

- Please do not send pull requests to our github mirror. They will be closed
  automatically.

- Please do not attach patches to issues, except in the special case of a fix
  for a security issue.

- Please prepare any merge request against a current git checkout of the
  GStreamer monorepo (gstreamer module), against the tip of the `main` branch.
  If a merge request is prepared against an old commit or older branch and
  can't be easily rebased you may be asked to rebase and update the branch on
  top of the `main` branch.

- If you have created a new plugin, please submit a merge request that adds it
  to `subprojects/gst-plugins-bad`, including any required `meson.build`
  modifications, new files and documentation.

#### Coding Style

Try to stick to the GStreamer indentation and coding style. There is a script
called [`gst-indent`][gst-indent] which you can run over your `.c` or `.cpp`
files if you want your code auto-indented before making the patch. The script
requires GNU indent to be installed already. Please do _not_ run `gst-indent` on
header files, our header file indentation is free-form. If you build GStreamer
from git, a local commit hook will be installed that checks if your commit
conforms to the required style (also using GNU indent).

Different versions of GNU indent may occasionally yield slightly different
indentations. If that happens, please ignore any indentation changes in
sections of code that your patch does not touch. You can do that by staging
changes selectively via `git add -p`. You can bypass the local indentation
check hook by using `git commit -n`, but it will still be checked again later
when you submit your changes through GitLab for merging.

We are working on making this less hasslesome.

[gst-indent]: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/main/scripts/gst-indent-all

Compiler requirements:
 - we are targetting the C99 compiler and preprocesser feature subset
   supported by gcc 5.4, clang and vs2017. Newer features can be
   used conditionally as long as there is a suitable fallback. This is similar
   to [GLib's compiler requirements](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib/CompilerRequirements).

Other style guidelines:
 - do not use tabs for indentation in new code, not even in freeform header files
 - do not use packed structures for parsing external data, instead use helper
   APIs such as [GstByteReader][bytereader] and [GstBitReader][bitreader] for
   data parsing
 - from GStreamer 1.20 onwards you may in particular also
   - use c++-style `// comments`
   - declare variables inline (as opposed to only at the beginning of a block)
   - use advanced/nicer struct initialisers

[bytereader]: https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/base/gstbytereader.html?gi-language=c#GstByteReader

### Writing Good Commit Messages

Please take the time to write good and concise commit messages.

The first line of each commit message should be a short and concise summary
of the commit. If the commit applies to a specific subsystem, library, plugin
or element, prefix the message with the name of the component, for example:

    oggdemux: fix granulepos query for the old theora bitstream

or

    docs: add new stream API

or

    tests: video: add unit test for converting RGB to XYZ colorspace

This should be a *summary* of the change and _not a description_ of the change.
Meaning: don't say *how* you did something but *what* you fixed, improved or
changed, what the most important practical *effect* of the change is. Example:

    qtdemux: fix crash when doing reverse playback in push mode (good)

instead of

    qtdemux: use signed integer to avoid counter underrun (bad)

The second line of the commit message should be empty.

The third and following lines should contain an extensive *description* and
*rationale* of the change made: what was changed, what was broken, how did it
get fixed, what bugs or issues does this fix? And most importantly: *why* was
something changed.

Trivial commits do not require a description, e.g. if you fix a memory leak
it's usually enough to just say that you fixed a leak. Maybe mention what was
leaked and perhaps also if it was an important leak or only happens in some
corner case error code path, but in any case there's no need to write a long
explanation why leaks are bad or why this needed fixing.

The important part is really what the reasoning behind the change is, since
that's what people want to know if they try to figure out twelve months later
why a line of code does what it does.

If the commit is related to any particular issues in gitlab, please add a
reference to the issue (e.g. `See #123` or `Fixes #123` if it fixes it the
issue). For issues in other repositories (gst-plugins-{base,good,ugly,bad} etc.)
please add the full issue URL to the commit message instead (or ask for the
issue to be moved to the monorepo gstreamer repository), e.g.

    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-foo/issues/123

We do not use `Signed-off by:` lines in GStreamer, please create commits
without such lines.

Please do not add references to private company-internal bug trackers or
code repositories in commit messages.

### After Submitting your Merge Request

Whenever you submit a new Merge Request, add a comment to an existing issue or
Merge Request, GitLab will send a notification e-mail to GStreamer
developers. This means that there is usually no need to advertise the fact that
you have done so in other forums such as on Matrix or Discourse, unless
you have been asked to file an issue there, in which case it's nice to follow up
with the link to the issue.

Most of all, please be patient.

We try to review patches as quickly as possible, but there is such a high
volume of issues, merge requests and feature requests that it is not always
possible to tend to them all as quickly as we'd like. This is especially
true for completely new plugins or new features.

If you haven't received any response at all for a while (say two weeks or so),
do feel free to ping developers by posting a quick follow-up comment on the
issue or merge request.

If you do not get a response, this is usually not a sign of people *ignoring*
the issue, but usually just means that it's fallen through the cracks or
people have been busy with other things.

Most GStreamer developers have a review workflow that's driven by e-mail or
GitLab notifications, so posting a follow-up comment is the best way to draw
attention to an issue or merge request.

### Updating Your Merge Request and Addressing Review Comments

When someone reviews your changes, they may leave review comments for
particular sections of code or in general. These will usually each start
a new "Discussion" which is basically a thread for each comment.

When you believe that you have addressed the issue raised in a discussion,
either by updating the code or answering the questions raised, you should
"Resolve the Discussion" using the button, ideally also leaving a comment
saying so (e.g. "done", "fixed", "updated", "no longer needed" or such). The
comment makes sure a notification e-mail is generated, which makes it easier
for GStreamer developers to keep track of what's happening.

At the top of each merge request in GitLab is a tracker with the number of
unresolved discussions. This way it's easy for maintainers (and yourself)
to see what's left to do and if there are any open questions/issues.

Whenever you have made changes to your patches locally you can just
`git push -f your-personal-gitlab-fork your-branch` to your personal fork.
GitLab will then pick up the changes automatically. You do _not_ need to submit
a new Merge Request whenever you make changes to an already-submitted patchset,
and in fact you shouldn't do that because it means all the previous discussion
context is lost and it's also not easy for reviewers to see what changed.
Just force-update your existing branch.

You do not need to add individial "fixup commits" to your branch when you address
issues raised. Instead just fix up the original commit(s) directly using
`git rebase` etc. GitLab is able to track and show changes made between
different revisions of a merge request branch, so just keep the branch always
to the "latest clean version". See the [Rewriting History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
section of the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more details.

GStreamer maintainers will typically receive e-mail notifications when you add
a comment and when all oustanding discussions have been resolved. They may or
may not receive e-mail notifications when you update the commits in your branch.

# Workflows for GStreamer developers

## Merging merge requests

Merge requests should be merged either by assigning the merge request to Marge,
our merge bot, or by adding the `Merge in X hours` or `Merge in X days` labels.

### Marge merge bot

Marge will rebase the merge request on top of the target branch and will
also automatically add `Part-of: <url>` footers to each commit that point
back to the merge request in gitlab.

When Marge rebases, the continuous integration (CI) pipeline will start
automatically and the merge request will get merged once it passes. Since
the CI pipeline is triggered by Marge in this case, it will also have the
right permissions to trigger the Cerbero sub-pipeline, which won't run for
monorepo pipelines triggered by external contributors.

Sidenote: Our CI pipelines don't start automatically usually, but are gated
by a manual trigger in order not to waste CI resources. However, pipelines
will start running automatically if Marge triggers them which will happen
when Marge rebases commits. This means that when pushing updates to a
merge request branch (especially if Marge touched it once already) it's
usually a good idea to either remove the `Part-of` footers from the top
commit message, or to not be entirely on top of the target branch, so that
Marge is forced to rebase again when being re-assigned the merge request.
Otherwise Marge will not rebase and wait for the pipeline to complete, but
the pipeline won't actually run because it's not been triggered.

If Marge is assigned a merge request but nothing happens, it usually means
she's busy with another merge request in the same project and target branch.
Check GitLab for a [list of merge requests assigned to Marge][marge-list]. If
no other merge requests are being processed, you may be encountering the above
pipeline trigger problem and may have to trigger the merge request pipeline
manually.

[marge-list]: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/groups/gstreamer/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=opened&assignee_username=gstreamer-merge-bot

### "Merge in X days" and "Merge in X hours" labels

We have a range of `Merge in X hours` or `Merge in X days` labels available.

When these labels are added to a merge request, Marge will assign the merge
request to herself after the specified amount of time has passed (roughly).

They can be useful for multiple purposes:

- Schedule merge requests for later in the day or night, when the
  CI farm is less busy

- Provide a heads-up to other developers that you intend to merge
  something, whilst still allowing some time for others to review or
  comment.

It's possible to subscribe to specific labels in GitLab and receive
notifications when they are added to a merge request.

When Marge picks up the label and assigns merge requests to itself, a
notification will be generated. When merging fails, a notification will
also be generated, which helps make sure things don't fall through the
cracks once they've been scheduled for merging.

It's of course fine for another developer to assign a merge request with
a `Merge in X` label to Marge immediately if they think it's fine to go in

## Backporting to a stable branch

Before backporting any changes to a stable branch, they should first be
applied to the `main` branch, and should obviously not have caused any known
outstanding regressions. The only exception here are changes that do not apply
to the `main` branch anymore.

You do not need to create backport merge requests against stable branches.
Backport merge requests for stable branches will be created automatically
based on labels on `main` branch merge requests.

Existing merge request against the `main` branch, including merged ones,
that should be considered for backporting in the future should be labeled with
the `Needs backport` label and the label for the target stable branch
(e.g. `1.18`). All merge requests with the [`Needs backport`][needs-backport]
label will be regularly considered for backporting by GStreamer developers.

Changes that add API or change existing API will usually not be considered
for backporting.

In case patches don't apply cleanly to the target stable branch, draft `WIP`
merge requests will be created by the above-mentioned scripts. If that happens
developers will have to backport the desired commits and resolve any cherry-pick
conflicts manually. The result should then be pushed into the existing branch
for the `WIP` backport merge request. Any GStreamer developer should be able
to do this, and help in this area is always welcome. Please resolve the WIP/Draft
status once all the relevant commits have been backported and assign the
merge request to the merge bot for merging.

There is also a [`Maybe backport` label][maybe-backport] which can be added
if you're not sure if commits should be backported or not, or you want to
revisit it later once the changes in question have seen some testing in the
development branch. If you tag a merge request with `Maybe backport` it's
usually useful to add a comment about why it's being tagged only as a maybe.
That will make it easier for others to evaluate whether it should be backported
or not later.
