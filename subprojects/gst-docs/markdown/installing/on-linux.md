# Installing on Linux

## Prerequisites

GStreamer is included in all Linux distributions. We recommend using the latest version of a fast moving distribution such as Fedora, Ubuntu (non-LTS), Debian sid or OpenSuse to get a recent GStreamer release.

All the commands given in this section are intended to be typed in from
a terminal.

Make sure you have superuser (root) access rights to install GStreamer.

## Install GStreamer on Fedora

Run the following command:

```
dnf install gstreamer1-devel gstreamer1-plugins-base-tools gstreamer1-doc gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras gstreamer1-plugins-ugly gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-extras
```

## Install GStreamer on Ubuntu or Debian

Run the following command:

```
apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio
```

## Building applications using GStreamer

The only other “development environment” that is required is
the `gcc` compiler and a text editor. In order to compile code that
requires GStreamer and uses the GStreamer core library, remember
to add this string to your `gcc` command:

```
pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0
```

If you're using other GStreamer libraries, e.g. the video library, you
have to add additional packages after gstreamer-1.0 in the above string
(gstreamer-video-1.0 for the video library, for example).

If your application is built with the help of libtool, e.g. when using
automake/autoconf as a build system, you have to run
the `configure` script from inside the `gst-sdk-shell` environment.

#### Getting the tutorial's source code

The source code for the tutorials can be copied and pasted from the
tutorial pages into a text file, but, for convenience, it is also available
in a GIT repository in the `subprojects/gst-docs/examples/tutorials` subdirectory.

The GIT repository can be cloned with:

```
git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer
```

#### Building the tutorials

```
gcc basic-tutorial-1.c -o basic-tutorial-1 `pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0`
```

Using the file name of the tutorial you are interested in
(`basic-tutorial-1` in this example).

> ![Warning](images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) Depending on the GStreamer libraries you need to use, you will have to add more packages to the `pkg-config` command, besides `gstreamer-1.0`
> At the bottom of each tutorial's source code you will find the command for that specific tutorial, including the required libraries, in the required order.
> When developing your own applications, the GStreamer documentation will tell you what library a function belongs to.

#### Running the tutorials

To run the tutorials, simply execute the desired tutorial:

``` c
./basic-tutorial-1
```
