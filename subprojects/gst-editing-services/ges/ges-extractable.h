/**
 * GESExtractableInterface:
 * @asset_type: The subclass type of #GESAsset that should be created when
 * an asset with the corresponding #GESAsset:extractable-type is
 * requested.
 * @check_id: The method to call to check whether a given ID is valid as
 * an asset #GESAsset:id for the given #GESAsset:extractable-type. The
 * returned ID is the actual #GESAsset:id that is set on the asset. The
 * default implementation will simply always return the type name of the
 * #GESAsset:extractable-type, even if the received ID is %NULL. As such,
 * any given ID is considered valid (or is ignored), but only one is
 * actually ever set on an asset, which means the given
 * #GESAsset:extractable-type can only have one associated asset.
 * @can_update_asset: Whether an object of this class can have its
 * #GESAsset change over its lifetime. This should be set to %TRUE if one
 * of the object's parameters that is associated with its ID can change
 * after construction, which would require an asset with a new ID. Note
 * that the subclass is required to handle the requesting and setting of
 * the new asset on the object.
 * @set_asset: This method is called after the #GESAsset of an object is
 * set. If your class supports the asset of an object changing, then you
 * can use this method to change the parameters of the object to match the
 * new asset #GESAsset:id. If setting the asset should be able to fail,
 * you should implement @set_asset_full instead.
 * @set_asset_full: Like @set_asset, but also allows you to return %FALSE
 * to indicate a failure to change the object in response to a change in
 * its asset.
 * @get_parameters_from_id: The method to call to get the object
 * properties corresponding to a given asset #GESAsset:id. The default
 * implementation will simply return no parameters. The default #GESAsset
 * will call this to set the returned properties on the extracted object,
 * but other subclasses may ignore this method.
 * @get_id: The method to fetch the #GESAsset:id of some associated asset.
 * Note that it may be the case that the object does not have its asset
 * set, or even that an asset with such an #GESAsset:id does not exist in
 * the GES cache. Instead, this should return the #GESAsset:id that is
 * _compatible_ with the current state of the object. The default
 * implementation simply returns the currently set asset ID, or the type name
 * of the object, which is what is used as the #GESAsset:id by default,
 * if no asset is set.
 * @get_real_extractable_type: The method to call to get the actual
 * #GESAsset:extractable-type an asset should have set, given the
 * requested #GESAsset:id. The default implementation simply returns the
 * same type as given. You can overwrite this if it is more appropriate
 * to extract the object from a subclass, depending on the requested
 * #GESAsset:id. Note that when an asset is requested, this method will be
 * called before the other class methods. In particular, this means that
 * the @check_id and @get_parameters_from_id class methods of the returned
 * type will be used (instead of our own).
 * @register_metas: The method to set metadata on an asset. This is called
 * on initiation of the asset, but before it begins to load its state.
