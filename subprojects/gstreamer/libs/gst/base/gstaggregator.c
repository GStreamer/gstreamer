/**
 * SECTION: gstaggregator
 * @title: GstAggregator
 * @short_description: Base class for mixers and muxers, manages a set of input
 *     pads and aggregates their streams
 * @see_also: gstcollectpads for historical reasons.
 *
 * Manages a set of pads with the purpose of aggregating their buffers.
 * Control is given to the subclass when all pads have data.
 *
 *  * Base class for mixers and muxers. Subclasses should at least implement
 *    the #GstAggregatorClass::aggregate virtual method.
 *
 *  * Installs a #GstPadChainFunction, a #GstPadEventFullFunction and a
 *    #GstPadQueryFunction to queue all serialized data packets per sink pad.
 *    Subclasses should not overwrite those, but instead implement
 *    #GstAggregatorClass::sink_event and #GstAggregatorClass::sink_query as
 *    needed.
 *
 *  * When data is queued on all pads, the aggregate vmethod is called.
 *
 *  * One can peek at the data on any given GstAggregatorPad with the
 *    gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() method, and remove it from the pad
 *    with the gst_aggregator_pad_pop_buffer () method. When a buffer
 *    has been taken with pop_buffer (), a new buffer can be queued
 *    on that pad.
 *
 *  * When gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() or gst_aggregator_pad_has_buffer()
 *    are called, a reference is taken to the returned buffer, which stays
 *    valid until either:
 *
 *      - gst_aggregator_pad_pop_buffer() is called, in which case the caller
 *        is guaranteed that the buffer they receive is the same as the peeked
 *        buffer.
 *      - gst_aggregator_pad_drop_buffer() is called, in which case the caller
 *        is guaranteed that the dropped buffer is the one that was peeked.
 *      - the subclass implementation of #GstAggregatorClass.aggregate returns.
 *
 *    Subsequent calls to gst_aggregator_pad_peek_buffer() or
 *    gst_aggregator_pad_has_buffer() return / check the same buffer that was
 *    returned / checked, until one of the conditions listed above is met.
 *
 *    Subclasses are only allowed to call these methods from the aggregate
 *    thread.
 *
 *  * If the subclass wishes to push a buffer downstream in its aggregate
 *    implementation, it should do so through the
 *    gst_aggregator_finish_buffer() method. This method will take care
 *    of sending and ordering mandatory events such as stream start, caps
 *    and segment. Buffer lists can also be pushed out with
 *    gst_aggregator_finish_buffer_list().
 *
 *  * Same goes for EOS events, which should not be pushed directly by the
 *    subclass, it should instead return GST_FLOW_EOS in its aggregate
 *    implementation.
 *
 *  * Note that the aggregator logic regarding gap event handling is to turn
 *    these into gap buffers with matching PTS and duration. It will also
 *    flag these buffers with GST_BUFFER_FLAG_GAP and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DROPPABLE
 *    to ease their identification and subsequent processing.
 *    In addition, if the gap event was flagged with GST_GAP_FLAG_MISSING_DATA,
 *    a custom meta is added to the resulting gap buffer (GstAggregatorMissingDataMeta).
 *
 *  * Subclasses must use (a subclass of) #GstAggregatorPad for both their
 *    sink and source pads.
 *    See gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template_with_gtype().
 *
 * This class used to live in gst-plugins-bad and was moved to core.
 *
 * Since: 1.14
