    video encoders and decoders which have been the standard on embedded Linux for quite some time now.

release has already been updated for the new GStreamer 1.24 API.

gst-plugins-rs, the module containing GStreamer plugins written in Rust, has also seen lots of activity with many new elements
and plugins

-   Rust plugins can be used from any programming language. To the outside they look just like a plugin written in C or C++.

Stable 1.24 branch

After the 1.24.0 release there will be several 1.24.x bug-fix releases which will contain bug fixes which have been deemed
suitable for a stable branch, but no new features or intrusive changes will be added to a bug-fix release usually. The 1.24.x
bug-fix releases will be made from the git 1.24 branch, which will be a stable branch.

1.24.0

1.24.0 has not yet been released.

Schedule for 1.26

Our next major feature release will be 1.26, and 1.25 will be the unstable development version leading up to the stable 1.26
release. The development of 1.25/1.25 will happen in the git main branch of the GStreamer mono repository.

The schedule for 1.26 is yet to be confirmed. We’re still busy getting 1.24 out!

1.26 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.24, 1.22, 1.20, 1.18, 1.16, 1.14, 1.12, 1.10, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0
release series.
