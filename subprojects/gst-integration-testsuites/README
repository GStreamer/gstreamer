This the official GStreamer integration testsuites implementation repository.
Those testsuites are meant to be used with GstValidate available in the
gst-devtools[0] repository

This repository includes both media files (available in medias/)
that will be retrieved from the web using medias/get_files.py and several
testsuites (available in testsuites/) to be used with gst-validate-launcher[1].

By default, gst-validate-launcher --sync will retrieve that repository to run
the default testsuite (namely validate and ges testsuites from testsuites/validate.py
and testsuites/ges.py)

For any USAGE documentation, you should refer to gst-validate documentation and
in particular to:

    $ gst-validate-launcher --help

Note that this repository uses [git-lfs] so you will need to install it before cloning.
