 * Vorbis packets can be short or long, and each packet overlaps the previous
 * and next packets.  The granulepos of a packet is always the last sample
 * that is completely decoded at the end of decoding that packet - i.e. the
 * last packet before the first overlapping packet.  If the sizes of packets
 * are 's' and 'l', then the increment will depend on the previous and next
 * packet types:
 *  v                             prev<<1 | next
 * lll:           l/2             3
 * lls:           3l/4 - s/4      2
 * lsl:           s/2
 * lss:           s/2
 * sll:           l/4 + s/4       1
 * sls:           l/2             0
 * ssl:           s/2
 * sss:           s/2
 *
 * The previous and next packet types can be inferred from the current packet
 * (additional information is not required)
 *
 * The two blocksizes can be determined from the first header packet, by reading
 * byte 28.  1 << (packet[28] >> 4) == long_size.
 * 1 << (packet[28] & 0xF) == short_size.
 *
 * (see http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html for specification)
