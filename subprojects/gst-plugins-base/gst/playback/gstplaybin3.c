/**
 * SECTION:element-playbin3
 * @title: playbin3
 *
 * playbin3 provides a stand-alone everything-in-one abstraction for an
 * audio and/or video player. It differs from the previous playbin (playbin2)
 * by supporting publication and selection of available streams via the
 * #GstStreamCollection message and #GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS event API.
 *
 * playbin3 can handle both audio and video files and features
 *
 * * automatic file type recognition and based on that automatic
 * selection and usage of the right audio/video/subtitle demuxers/decoders
 *
 * * auxiliary files - such as external subtitles and audio tracks
 * * visualisations for audio files
 * * subtitle support for video files. Subtitles can be store in external
 *   files.
 * * stream selection between different video/audio/subtitles streams
 * * meta info (tag) extraction
 * * easy access to the last video sample
 * * buffering when playing streams over a network
 * * volume control with mute option
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * A playbin element can be created just like any other element using
 * gst_element_factory_make(). The file/URI to play should be set via the #GstPlayBin3:uri
 * property. This must be an absolute URI, relative file paths are not allowed.
 * Example URIs are file:///home/joe/movie.avi or http://www.joedoe.com/foo.ogg
 *
 * Playbin3 is a #GstPipeline. It will notify the application of everything
 * that's happening (errors, end of stream, tags found, state changes, etc.)
 * by posting messages on its #GstBus. The application needs to watch the
 * bus.
 *
 * Playback can be initiated by setting the element to PLAYING state using
 * gst_element_set_state(). Note that the state change will take place in
 * the background in a separate thread, when the function returns playback
 * is probably not happening yet and any errors might not have occurred yet.
 * Applications using playbin3 should ideally be written to deal with things
 * completely asynchroneous.
 *
 * When playback has finished (an EOS message has been received on the bus)
 * or an error has occurred (an ERROR message has been received on the bus) or
 * the user wants to play a different track, playbin3 should be set back to
 * READY or NULL state, then the #GstPlayBin3:uri property should be set to the
 * new location and then playbin3 be set to PLAYING state again.
 *
 * Seeking can be done using gst_element_seek_simple() or gst_element_seek()
 * on the playbin3 element. Again, the seek will not be executed
 * instantaneously, but will be done in a background thread. When the seek
 * call returns the seek will most likely still be in process. An application
 * may wait for the seek to finish (or fail) using gst_element_get_state() with
 * -1 as the timeout, but this will block the user interface and is not
 * recommended at all.
 *
 * Applications may query the current position and duration of the stream
 * via gst_element_query_position() and gst_element_query_duration() and
 * setting the format passed to GST_FORMAT_TIME. If the query was successful,
 * the duration or position will have been returned in units of nanoseconds.
 *
 * ## Selecting streams
 *
 * The recommended way to select streams (instead of the default selection) is
 * to listen to GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_COLLECTION messages on the GstBus and send a
 * GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS on the pipeline with the selected streams. This
 * provides more information and flexibility compared to the legacy #GstPlayBin
 * property and signal-based mechanism.
 *
 * Note: The application should not assume that collections will not change
 * throughout a single file. If it wishes to modify the default selection, it
 * should always respond to new collections posted on the bus with a
 * GST_EVENT_SELECT_STREAMS.
 *
 * ## Advanced Usage: specifying the audio and video sink
 *
 * By default, if no audio sink or video sink has been specified via the
 * #GstPlayBin3:audio-sink or #GstPlayBin3:video-sink property, playbin3 will use the autoaudiosink
 * and autovideosink elements to find the first-best available output method.
 * This should work in most cases, but is not always desirable. Often either
 * the user or application might want to specify more explicitly what to use
 * for audio and video output.
 *
 * If the application wants more control over how audio or video should be
 * output, it may create the audio/video sink elements itself (for example
 * using gst_element_factory_make()) and provide them to playbin3 using the
 * #GstPlayBin3:audio-sink or #GstPlayBin3:video-sink property.
 *
 * GNOME-based applications, for example, will usually want to create
 * gconfaudiosink and gconfvideosink elements and make playbin3 use those,
 * so that output happens to whatever the user has configured in the GNOME
 * Multimedia System Selector configuration dialog.
 *
 * The sink elements do not necessarily need to be ready-made sinks. It is
 * possible to create container elements that look like a sink to playbin3,
 * but in reality contain a number of custom elements linked together. This
 * can be achieved by creating a #GstBin and putting elements in there and
 * linking them, and then creating a sink #GstGhostPad for the bin and pointing
 * it to the sink pad of the first element within the bin. This can be used
 * for a number of purposes, for example to force output to a particular
 * format or to modify or observe the data before it is output.
 *
 * It is also possible to 'suppress' audio and/or video output by using
 * 'fakesink' elements (or capture it from there using the fakesink element's
 * "handoff" signal, which, nota bene, is fired from the streaming thread!).
 *
 * ## Retrieving Tags and Other Meta Data
 *
 * Most of the common meta data (artist, title, etc.) can be retrieved by
 * watching for TAG messages on the pipeline's bus (see above).
 *
 * Other more specific meta information like width/height/framerate of video
 * streams or samplerate/number of channels of audio streams can be obtained
 * from the negotiated caps on the sink pads of the sinks.
 *
 * ## Buffering
 * Playbin3 handles buffering automatically for the most part, but applications
 * need to handle parts of the buffering process as well. Whenever playbin3 is
 * buffering, it will post BUFFERING messages on the bus with a percentage
 * value that shows the progress of the buffering process. Applications need
 * to set playbin3 to PLAYING or PAUSED state in response to these messages.
 * They may also want to convey the buffering progress to the user in some
 * way. Here is how to extract the percentage information from the message:
 * |[
 * switch (GST_MESSAGE_TYPE (msg)) {
 *   case GST_MESSAGE_BUFFERING: {
 *     gint percent = 0;
 *     gst_message_parse_buffering (msg, &percent);
 *     g_print ("Buffering (%u percent done)", percent);
 *     break;
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that applications should keep/set the pipeline in the PAUSED state when
 * a BUFFERING message is received with a buffer percent value < 100 and set
 * the pipeline back to PLAYING state when a BUFFERING message with a value
 * of 100 percent is received (if PLAYING is the desired state, that is).
 *
 * ## Embedding the video window in your application
 * By default, playbin3 (or rather the video sinks used) will create their own
 * window. Applications will usually want to force output to a window of their
 * own, however. This can be done using the #GstVideoOverlay interface, which most
 * video sinks implement. See the documentation there for more details.
 *
 * ## Specifying which CD/DVD device to use
 *
 * The device to use for CDs/DVDs needs to be set on the source element playbin3
 * creates before it is opened. The most generic way of doing this is to connect
 * to playbin3's "source-setup" signal, which will be emitted by playbin3 when
 * it has created the source element for a particular URI. In the signal
 * callback you can check if the source element has a "device" property and set
 * it appropriately. In some cases the device can also be set as part of the
 * URI, but it depends on the elements involved if this will work or not. For
 * example, for DVD menu playback, the following syntax might work (if the
 * resindvd plugin is used): dvd://[/path/to/device]
 *
 * ## Handling redirects
 *
 * Some elements may post 'redirect' messages on the bus to tell the
 * application to open another location. These are element messages containing
 * a structure named 'redirect' along with a 'new-location' field of string
 * type. The new location may be a relative or an absolute URI. Examples
 * for such redirects can be found in many quicktime movie trailers.
 *
 * NOTE: playbin3 (via uridecodebin3) will handle the redirect messages if
 * possible. The message will only be forwarded if it can't handle it.
 *
 * ## Examples
 * |[
 * gst-launch-1.0 -v playbin3 uri=file:///path/to/somefile.mp4
 * ]|
 *  This will play back the given AVI video file, given that the video and
 * audio decoders required to decode the content are installed. Since no
 * special audio sink or video sink is supplied (via playbin3's audio-sink or
 * video-sink properties) playbin3 will try to find a suitable audio and
 * video sink automatically using the autoaudiosink and autovideosink elements.
 * |[
 * gst-launch-1.0 -v playbin3 uri=cdda://4
 * ]|
 *  This will play back track 4 on an audio CD in your disc drive (assuming
 * the drive is detected automatically by the plugin).
 * |[
 * gst-launch-1.0 -v playbin3 uri=dvd://
 * ]|
 *  This will play back the DVD in your disc drive (assuming
 * the drive is detected automatically by the plugin).
