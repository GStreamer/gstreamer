Overview
--------

gstreamer-vaapi consists in a collection of VA-API based plugins for
GStreamer and helper libraries.

  * `vaapi<CODEC>dec' is used to decode JPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4:2, H.264
    AVC, H.264 MVC, VP8, VP9, VC-1, WMV3, HEVC videos to VA surfaces,
    depending on the actual value of <CODEC> and the underlying
    hardware capabilities.  This plugin is also able to implicitly
    download the decoded surface to raw YUV buffers.

  * `vaapi<CODEC>enc' is used to encode into MPEG-2, H.264 AVC, H.264
    MVC, JPEG, VP8, VP9, HEVC videos, depending on the actual value of
    <CODEC> (mpeg2, h264, etc.) and the hardware capabilities. By
    default, raw format bitstreams are generated, so the result may be
    piped to a muxer, e.g. qtmux for MP4 containers.

  * `vaapipostproc' is used to filter VA surfaces, for e.g. scaling,
    deinterlacing (bob, motion-adaptive, motion-compensated), noise
    reduction or sharpening. This plugin is also used to upload raw
    YUV pixels into VA surfaces.

  * `vaapisink' is used to render VA surfaces to an X11 or Wayland
    display. This plugin also features a "headless" mode (DRM) more
    suited to remote transcode scenarios, with faster throughput.

  * `vaapioverlay` is a accelerated compositor that blends or
    composite different video streams.

Requirements
------------

Hardware requirements

  * Hardware supported by i965 driver or iHD, such as
    - Intel Ironlake, Sandybridge, Ivybridge, Haswell, Broadwell,
      Skylake, etc. (HD Graphics)
    - Intel BayTrail, Braswell
    - Intel Poulsbo (US15W)
    - Intel Medfield or Cedar Trail
  * Hardware supported by AMD Radeonsi driver, such as the list below
    - AMD Carrizo, Bristol Ridge, Raven Ridge, Picasso, Renoir
    - AMD Tonga, Fiji, Polaris XX, Vega XX, Navi 1X
  * Other hardware supported by Mesa VA gallium state-tracker


Usage
-----

  VA elements are automatically plugged into GStreamer pipelines. So,
  using playbin should work as is.
  However, here are a few alternate pipelines that could be manually
  constructed.

  * Play an H.264 video with an MP4 container in fullscreen mode
  $ gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=/path/to/video.mp4 ! \
      qtdemux ! vaapidecodebin ! vaapisink fullscreen=true

  * Play a raw MPEG-2 interlaced stream
  $ gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=/path/to/mpeg2.bits ! \
      mpegvideoparse ! vaapimpeg2dec ! vaapipostproc ! vaapisink

  * Convert from one pixel format to another, while also downscaling
  $ gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=/path/to/raw_video.yuv ! \
      videoparse format=yuy2 width=1280 height=720 ! \
      vaapipostproc format=nv12 height=480 ! vaapisink

  * Encode a 1080p stream in raw I420 format into H.264
  $ gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=/path/to/raw_video.yuv ! \
      videoparse format=i420 width=1920 height=1080 framerate=30/1 ! \
      vaapih264enc rate-control=cbr tune=high-compression ! \
      qtmux ! filesink location=/path/to/encoded_video.mp4
