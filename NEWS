This is GStreamer 1.0.7

Changes since 1.0.6:

      * Add better support for static plugins

Bugs fixed since 1.0.6:

      * 667305 : build: Add --enable-static-plugins configure argument
      * 696357 : Basesrc may send not-neg error when flushed
      * 696435 : gst_static_caps_get(GST_STATIC_CAPS_NONE) doesn't work properly
      * 697791 : gst-inspect: shows action signal return pointers as pointers

Changes since 1.0.5:

      * bin: reset GValue from iterator after usage, fixing leak
      * pipeline: fix seeking on pipeline with NULL clock
      * message: accept NULL error argument in gst_message_parse_{error,warning,info}
      * basesrc: handle renegotiation correctly
      * basesink: handle sync of EOS after item without duration
      * basetransform: avoid warnings from NULL outcaps passed to transform_size in shutdown race
      * adapter, basesrc, typefind: handle gst_buffer_map failure
      * queuearray: fix gst_queue_array_drop_element() 
      * queuearray: fix gst_queue_array_find()
      * queue: remove query from queue if queue is flushing
      * g-i: make sure enumeration types and flags are introspected and available to bindings
      * g-i: add allow-none annotation for gst_pipeline_new()'s name property

Bugs fixed since 1.0.5:

      * 684804 : basesink: fails to post EOS message with RTSP stream
      * 691185 : g-i: GStreamer enums and flags not usable - " expected enumeration type GstFormat, but got Format instead " warning when setting GstFormat property on GStreamer appsrc element
      * 691985 : gst_pad_check_reconfigure: only remove flag if set.
      * 691986 : basesrc: set NEED_RECONFIGURE flag if negotiate fails
      * 692691 : queue: dangling pointer when doing allocation query on a flushing queue
      * 692868 : basesink: expands GAP event without duration to last to segment end
      * 693065 : pipeline: criticals when seeking on pipeline with NULL clock
      * 693587 : Adding offset to GstSegment deserialize/serialize to fix jump on uninitialized value
      * 693704 : gst_message_parse_{warning,error} annotations wrongly claim allow-none for GError parameter
      * 693996 : basetransform: audioresample shutdown unit test fails with 'gst_audio_info_from_caps: caps != NULL'  in transform_size

Changes since 1.0.4:

      * add GST_BIN_FLAG_NO_RESYNC flag that disables a resync when
        an element is added, removed or linked in the bin; this is
        interesting for complex bins that dynamically add elements
        to themselves and want to manage the state of those elements
        without interference from state resync threads (which may
        cause deadlocks)
      * add OTHER clock type

Bugs fixed since 1.0.4:

      * 690915 : Replace AM_CONFIG_HEADER with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS in configure.ac

API additions since 1.0.4:

      * GST_BIN_FLAG_NO_RESYNC
      * GST_CLOCK_TYPE_OTHER

Changes since 1.0.3:

      * basesrc: fix potential leaks when re-activating in a different mode
      * bindings: make all pad probe types work with bindings
      * bindings: fix gst_event_parse_stream_start() annotation, fixing crash
      * documentation improvements

Bugs fixed since 1.0.3:

      * 687845 : filesrc: leaks file descriptor if activation in pull mode fails
      * 688804 : Getting error trying to add a pad_probe
      * 688934 : Gst.Event.parse_stream_start seems to not function correctly

Changes since 1.0.2:

      * bufferpool: fix deadlock
      * baseparse: forward stream-start event in push mode, fixing issues with streamsynchronizer

      * 666053 : baseparse: prevent excessively high memory usage with large streams
      * 687896 : bufferpool: deadlock in GstBufferPool
      * 688477 : inputselector: fix clock leak in wait_running_time
      * 688511 : Windows compilers without pthreads still have testrtpool.c being built in tests
      * 688655 : baseparse: stream-start events not sent in push mode

      * 686787 : testrtpool must be linked to pthreads
