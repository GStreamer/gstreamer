This is GStreamer 1.6.4

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the fourth and likely last
bugfix release in the old stable 1.6 release series of your favourite
cross-platform multimedia framework!

This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from 1.6.x.

This release maintains API/ABI backwards compatibility with the
GStreamer 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 release series.

Bug fix summary:

 - audio parsers: make sure to send tags before pushing the first buffer,
   so all metadata is available at preroll. Fixes metadata collection in
   mopidy with certain FLAC files.

 - fix decoding glitches at the beginning of some mp3 streams when streaming

 - multiqueue eos handling fixes

 - tcpserversink/multisocketsink: fix 100% cpu usage on client disconnect

 - video4linux: colorimetry and colorspace handling fixes

 - udpsrc: add option to enable/disable multicast loopback ("loop" property)

 - RTP JPEG: depayloader robustness fixes; payloader now accepts different
   quant tables for the chroma components

 - directsoundsink: fix some issues around muting/unmuting the sound

 - dvdreadsrc: don't jump to wrong title when seeking back to 0 for titles != 1

 - adaptivedemux: fix race on shutdown that could result in deadlocks
   in hlsdemux/dashdemux, especially when stopped before playback started

 - decklink: various robustness fixes in decklinkaudiosrc and decklinkvideosrc

 - mpeg4parser: prevent assertion when scanning for sync code

 - fbdevsink: fix crash caused by wrong bpp calculation

 - tsdemux: fix hang in preroll caused by bogus timestamp/wraparound
   handling in some corner cases

 - tsdemux: fix accurating seeking

 - h265parse: fix crash converting from hevc format to nal-aligned bytestream

 - h264parse, h265parse: fix handling of downstream force-key-unit events

 - g-i annotation fixes for bindings for gst_element_query_convert(),

   gst_pad_get_current_caps(), and gst_pad_peer_query_caps()

 - gst-libav: update internal libav copy to n2.8.6

 - rtsp-server: report RECORD and ANNOUNCE as supported in the OPTIONS

 - rtsp-server: prevent receival of looped back packets on Windows if a
   multicast transport is used

 - various minor memory leak fixes

 - miscellaneous other fixes

 - fix crashes on newer windows versions when GTypes are passed through
   vararg functions as is done in souphttpsrc or during ges_init(). This
   would manifest itself if the application was compiled with MSVC
   and /DYNAMICBASE (address space layout randomization) was used.
